What is the distribution of arrival rate in an M/M/1 queuing model?

a) Exponential distribution 
b) Geometric distribution 
c) Normal distribution 
d) Poisson distribution
? 
d) Poisson distribution

In an M/M/1 queuing model, the arrival rate is characterized by a **Poisson distribution**, meaning arrivals occur randomly and independently over time with a constant average rate, $Î»$.

Key points include:

- **Randomness**: The number of arrivals in a given time period can vary.
- **Memoryless Property**: The likelihood of an arrival is independent of previous arrivals.
- **Single Server**: There is one server handling arrivals.

### Other Choices:

a) **Exponential Distribution**: Models the time between events in a Poisson process.

b) **Geometric Distribution**: Represents the number of trials until the first success in independent Bernoulli trials.

c) **Normal Distribution**: A symmetric distribution commonly found in nature, not typically used for queuing arrivals.
