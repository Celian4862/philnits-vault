Typical list data type implementations are either array based or pointer based. Which of
the following describes a characteristic of array-based implementations?

a) In addition to space for each element in a list, space for a pointer to the next element is
also required.
b) Moving to the middle of a list takes an amount of time proportional to the number of
elements, as it requires visiting all the entries from the beginning to the middle.
c) Regardless of the actual number of elements in a list, insertion and removal of an
element can be performed in a fixed time.
d) Regardless of the actual number of elements in a list, some space may remain unused as
the space for storing the maximum number of elements is pre-allocated.
? 
d) Regardless of the actual number of elements in a list, some space may remain unused as
the space for storing the maximum number of elements is pre-allocated.

### Why the other choices are incorrect:

- **a) In addition to space for each element in a list, space for a pointer to the next element is also required.**
    
    - This describes **pointer-based** implementations (e.g., linked lists), where each node holds a pointer to the next node. In array-based implementations, pointers between elements are not needed.
- **b) Moving to the middle of a list takes an amount of time proportional to the number of elements, as it requires visiting all the entries from the beginning to the middle.**
    
    - This is true for **pointer-based** implementations (like linked lists), but in array-based implementations, direct access to any element by index takes constant time, O(1)O(1)O(1).
- **c) Regardless of the actual number of elements in a list, insertion and removal of an element can be performed in a fixed time.**
    
    - In array-based implementations, **insertion** or **removal** requires shifting elements, which takes time proportional to the number of elements, O(n)O(n)O(n), so it's not fixed time. This is true only for linked lists under certain conditions.
