## **Concepts To Know:**

#### **Critical Path Method (CPM):**

The **Critical Path Method (CPM)** is a project management technique used to determine the longest sequence of dependent activities that must be completed on time to ensure the entire project is completed on schedule. It helps to identify:

1. **Critical Path**: The longest path through the project network. Any delay in this path directly delays the project.
2. **Activity**: A task that consumes time and resources.
3. **Dummy Activity**: A placeholder used to show dependency but takes no time.
4. **Earliest Start (ES) / Latest Finish (LF)**: Used to track the start and finish times for activities and calculate slack (extra time).

#### **Calculating Path Durations:**

To find the minimum project completion time, you must identify all possible paths from the start to the end of the project and sum up the durations of activities on each path. The critical path is the one with the longest duration.

### **We Check Each Path by Summing the Durations:**

#### Path 1: **A → E → G → I**

- **Duration** = 3 + 11 + 8 + 4 = **26 days**

#### Path 2: **A → D → G → I**

- **Duration** = 3 + 7 + 8 + 4 = **22 days**

#### Path 3: **B → C → G → I**

- **Duration** = 8 + 4 + 8 + 4 = **24 days**

#### Path 4: **B → F → H → I**

- **Duration** = 8 + 7 + 6 + 4 = **25 days**

### **Conclusion:**

The longest path is **Path 1 (A → E → G → I)** with a duration of **26 days**, making this the **minimum project completion time**.

This makes the correct answer: **d) 26 days**
