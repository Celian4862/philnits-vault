Which of the following is a TCP/IP protocol that is used to find the corresponding MAC address from an IP address?

**a) ARP** 

**b) ICMP** 

**c) IP** 

**d) RARP**
? 
**a) ARP**

## **Explanation:**

**ARP** is used to find the corresponding MAC address for a given IP address in a local network. It operates by sending a request to all devices on the network, asking who owns the specific IP address, and the device with that IP address responds with its MAC address. Therefore, the answer is **a)**.

**b) ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol)**: Used for sending error messages and operational information, such as with the `ping` command.

**c) IP (Internet Protocol)**: Responsible for delivering packets from the source host to the destination host based on IP addresses.

**d) RARP (Reverse Address Resolution Protocol)**: Used to find an IP address from a given MAC address, which is the reverse process of ARP. However, it is rarely used now.
