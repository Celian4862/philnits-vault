### What is feedback control?
- **Feedback control** is a fundamental concept in control systems engineering. It involves monitoring the output of a system and making adjustments based on the difference between the desired and actual performance. The primary goal is to maintain system stability and ensure that the output meets the desired specifications despite external disturbances or internal variations.

### Looking over the options:

- **a)**   *It detects disturbance and takes a corrective action to prevent its influence.*
    This accurately describes feedback control. It detects disturbances in the system and takes corrective actions to prevent those disturbances from further influencing the system. Feedback control reacts **after** detecting deviations in output.

- **b)**   *It is vulnerable to disturbance and the influence of the disturbance is amplified*
    This is incorrect because feedback control is not vulnerable to disturbances; it is designed to minimize or correct them. It does the opposite of amplifying disturbances.

- **c)**   *It predicts disturbance and takes a corrective action accordingly*
    This describes **feedforward control**, where the system predicts disturbances and acts preemptively. Feedback control doesn't predict; it reacts **after** detecting a disturbance.

- **d)** *It takes a corrective action after detecting the influence of a disturbance*
    While feedback control does take corrective action after detecting a disturbance, this option doesnâ€™t emphasize the preventive aspect as clearly as **a)** does. Feedback control not only reacts but also prevents further negative influence, which **a)** highlights better.
