## **Concepts To Know:**

#### **Three-Point Estimation:**

Three-point estimation is a technique used in **project management** to estimate the duration of a task by considering uncertainty. It uses three key estimates:

1. **Optimistic Estimate (O)**: Best-case scenario, where the activity takes the least time.
2. **Most Likely Estimate (M)**: The most realistic, or average duration.
3. **Pessimistic Estimate (P)**: Worst-case scenario, where the activity takes the most time.
   
#### **Triangular Distribution Formula:**

To calculate the **expected duration** using the **triangular distribution**, we use the formula:

$$ 
Expected\: Duration\: (E) = \frac{O + M + P}{3} 
$$

- **O**: Optimistic estimate
- **M**: Most likely estimate
- **P**: Pessimistic estimate


### **We Check Each Answer by Using the Formula:**

We are given the following estimates for the activity:

- **Optimistic (O)** = 2 days (if an experienced employee is assigned)
- **Most Likely (M)** = 4 days (if an average employee is assigned)
- **Pessimistic (P)** = 12 days (if an inexperienced employee is assigned)

Let‚Äôs plug these values into the triangular distribution formula:

$$ùê∏ = \frac{2 + 4 + 12}{3} = \frac{18}{3}  = 6 \: days$$
