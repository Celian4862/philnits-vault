On a computer with virtual memory, the number of blocks in real memory is three (3). One of the two (2) algorithms of FIFO and LFU (least frequently used) is used for selecting the page to be removed from real memory. When five (5) pages are referenced in the page-reference sequence shown below as a string, which of the following is an appropriate combination of the number of page fault operations for each algorithm? Here, the three (3) blocks in the real memory are initially empty.

## **Explanation:**

To determine the number of page faults for the FIFO (First-In-First-Out) and LFU (Least Frequently Used) page replacement algorithms with the given page reference string $1, 3, 2, 1, 4, 5, 2, 3, 4, 5$ and three empty memory blocks, let's analyze each algorithm step by step.
#### **Page Reference String:**
	$1, 3, 2, 1, 4, 5, 2, 3, 4, 5$
### **FIFO (First-In-First-Out)**
- **Reference 1**: **Page fault** (load 1) - Memory: [1]
- **Reference 3**: **Page fault** (load 3) - Memory: [1, 3]
- **Reference 2**: **Page fault** (load 2) - Memory: [1, 3, 2]
- **Reference 1**: No page fault (1 is already in memory) - Memory: [1, 3, 2]
- **Reference 4**: **Page fault** (replace 1 with 4) - Memory: [4, 3, 2]
- **Reference 5**: **Page fault** (replace 3 with 5) - Memory: [4, 5, 2]
- **Reference 2**: No page fault (2 is already in memory) - Memory: [4, 5, 2]
- **Reference 3**: **Page fault** (replace 2 with 3) - Memory: [4, 5, 3]
- **Reference 4**: No page fault (4 is already in memory) - Memory: [4, 5, 3]
- **Reference 5**: No page fault (5 is already in memory) - Memory: [4, 5, 3]

**Total Page Faults for FIFO**: **6**
### **LFU (Least Frequently Used)**
For LFU, we keep track of how many times each page is referenced and remove the least frequently used one in case of a fault. Here's how it goes:
- **Reference 1**: Page fault (load 1) - Memory: [1], Frequency: {1: 1}
- **Reference 3**: Page fault (load 3) - Memory: [1, 3], Frequency: {1: 1, 3: 1}
- **Reference 2**: Page fault (load 2) - Memory: [1, 3, 2], Frequency: {1: 1, 3: 1, 2: 1}
- **Reference 1**: No page fault (1 is already in memory) - Memory: [1, 3, 2], Frequency: {1: 2, 3: 1, 2: 1}
- **Reference 4**: Page fault (remove 3, which has the lowest frequency) - Memory: [1, 2, 4], Frequency: {1: 2, 2: 1, 4: 1}
- **Reference 5**: Page fault (remove 2, which has the lowest frequency) - Memory: [1, 4, 5], Frequency: {1: 2, 4: 1, 5: 1}
- **Reference 2**: Page fault (remove 4, which has the lowest frequency) - Memory: [1, 5, 2], Frequency: {1: 2, 5: 1, 2: 1}
- **Reference 3**: Page fault (remove 5, which has the lowest frequency) - Memory: [1, 2, 3], Frequency: {1: 2, 2: 2, 3: 1}
- **Reference 4**: Page fault (remove 3, which has the lowest frequency) - Memory: [1, 2, 4], Frequency: {1: 2, 2: 2, 4: 1}
- **Reference 5**: Page fault (remove 4, which has the lowest frequency) - Memory: [1, 2, 5], Frequency: {1: 2, 2: 2, 5: 1}

**Total Page Faults for LFU**: **9**

### **Conclusion:**
- **FIFO**: 6 page faults
- **LFU**: 9 page faults

Therefore, the correct answer is **d**.
