In an OS, task scheduling is performed by the priority order method. The table below shows the priorities for three (3) tasks A to C and the execution sequence and execution time of the CPU and I/O device for the tasks when each task is executed individually. What is the idle time of the CPU in milliseconds from the time when the three (3) tasks are set to the ready state to the time when the execution of all of the tasks is finished? Here, there is one (1) CPU, the CPU consists of one (1) core, there is no I/O contention, and no overhead of the OS is considered. In the table below, the numbers in parentheses indicate the execution time for each operation.

**a) 2**

**b) 3**

**c) 4**

**d) 5**
? 
**b) 3**

## **Explanation:**

Idle time of the CPU refers to the timeframe where the CPU is not in use. To answer this question, we have to visualize the execution sequence of the Operating System.

### **Conclusion:**

The CPU has an idle time of 2 + 1 = 3 ms so the answer is **b)**.
