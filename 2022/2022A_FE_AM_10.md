Which of the following is a technology used to provide dynamic UI contents without reloading the entire web page by using an asynchronous communication feature of JavaScript?

**a) It determines the storage location using a function of a key.**

**b) It is a method that avoids collisions among storage locations.**

**c) It is one of the methods that use a binary tree.**

**d) It takes time almost proportional to the table size for searching.**
? 
**a) It determines the storage location using a function of a key.**
## **Explanation:**
**Hashing** uses a hash function to convert a key into an index in a hash table. The hash function takes the key as input and produces a hash code, which is then used to determine the location where the corresponding value will be stored. Therefore the closest answer is **a**.

**b)** While hashing aims to minimize the number of collisions (when two different keys hash to the same index), it cannot entirely avoid them due to the limited number of available storage locations compared to the potentially infinite number of keys. Instead, hash tables implement strategies (such as chaining or open addressing) to handle collisions when they occur.

**c)** Hashing and binary trees are different data structures used for searching and storing data. Binary trees, particularly binary search trees (BST), organize data in a hierarchical manner and allow for ordered retrieval. Hashing, on the other hand, relies on hash tables and does not use tree structures to store data.

**d)** The average-case time complexity for searching in a well-designed hash table is **constant time**, denoted as $O(1)$, rather than being proportional to the size of the table. However, in the worst case (e.g., when many collisions occur), the time complexity can degrade to $O(n)$, where $n$ is the number of elements stored in the hash table. Nonetheless, a good hash function and collision resolution strategy typically keep search times close to constant.
