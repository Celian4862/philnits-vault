Which of the following is an appropriate test type that is conducted to ensure that the interfaces and linkages between different software parts work properly?
a) Acceptance test
b) Functional test
c) Integration test
d) Performance test
? 
c) Integration test
## **Explanation:**

A type of software testing that specifically focuses on how different parts of a software system work together. This kind of testing ensures that the components or modules of a system interact correctly once combined, rather than focusing on individual components.

- A) Acceptance test: Acceptance testing is done to confirm that the software meets business requirements and is ready for delivery. It is performed later in the software lifecycle and focuses on whether the system satisfies user needs and acceptance criteria. This test type is not focused on checking how components interact but on the system's overall readiness.
- B) Functional test: Functional testing ensures that each function of the software operates according to specifications. It checks the application's functionality by providing inputs and comparing the actual output to the expected one, but it doesnâ€™t focus on the interactions between multiple parts or modules of the system.
- **C) Integration test: Integration testing is a software testing technique that verifies the interactions between different software components or modules. After individual components have passed unit testing, they are integrated, and the goal is to test how they function as a whole. It helps detect issues related to the integration of different parts, ensuring they work together as expected.**
- D) Performance test: Performance testing evaluates how the system behaves under a specific workload. It focuses on factors like system responsiveness, stability, and scalability rather than on interactions between software components or modules.
