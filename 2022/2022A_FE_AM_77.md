# 2022A_FE_AM_77 %% ex. 2024S_FE-A_83 %%

Which of the following is a chart that represents values over a period (frequently one year) and shows simultaneously monthly figures (or weekly or daily), cumulative totals, and the moving averages? 

**a) Pie intersection chart** 

**b) Radar chart** 

**c) SD chart** 

**d) Z chart (Z graph)**
? 
**d) Z chart (Z graph)**

## **Explanation:**

A **Z chart (Z graph)** is designed to display values over a specified period, often one year, and can show monthly figures (or weekly or daily), cumulative totals, and moving averages simultaneously. This makes it useful for tracking performance, trends, and patterns over time.

### Overview of Other Options:

- **a)** **Pie intersection chart**: Typically shows proportions of a whole at a single moment in time, not over a period.
- **b)** **Radar chart**: Visualizes multivariate data on a two-dimensional graph but is not used for time-series analysis.
- **c)** **SD chart**: Focuses on standard deviation rather than providing a comprehensive view of cumulative totals and moving averages over time.

Therefore, the answer is **d)**.
