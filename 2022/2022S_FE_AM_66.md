## **Explanation:**

#### **Market / Competitive Positioning:**

Market positioning or competitive positioning refers to how companies classify their position in the market compared to their competitors. This classification helps shape their business strategy and determines how they approach the market. Companies are typically grouped into four main categories: **Nicher**, **Follower**, **Challenger**, and **Leader.**

1. **Market Nicher**: A company that targets a specific, often small, segment of the market. They focus their resources on serving this niche with specialized products or services that larger companies may overlook.

2. **Market Follower**: A company that chooses not to compete head-on with the leader but instead follows their strategies. They tend to avoid risky moves and focus on maintaining a stable market presence.

3. **Market Challenger**: A company that is actively trying to gain more market share and compete with the leader. Their strategy is often aggressive, focusing on innovation, improving products, or finding gaps in the leader’s market coverage.

4. **Market Leader**: The company with the highest market share and dominance in the industry. They often set industry standards and benefit from economies of scale. The leader's focus is usually on maintaining their position and expanding total market demand.

## **Checking:**

- **a) Applying a differentiation strategy to all aspects of products, services, advertising, price, and distribution channels or indirectly attacking the competitor’s weaknesses or the gaps in the competitor’s market coverage.**  
  
    This answer describes a strategy that applies to **market challengers**. Challengers aim to differentiate themselves in order to attack competitors, especially the market leader, by finding and exploiting weaknesses or gaps. Their goal is to disrupt the leader's dominance.

- **b) Capturing a specific market that high-ranking companies do not target and concentrating management resources in order to secure and maintain predominance in the market.**  
  
    This strategy is characteristic of a **market nicher**. Niche companies focus on serving a very specific segment of the market that larger companies ignore or under-serve, allowing them to maintain a strong position in their specialized area.

- **c) Determining the challenger company’s real ability in the market and prioritizing securing stable profits over expanding the market share by doing as the leader company does.**  
  
    This answer describes a **market follower**. Followers imitate the strategies of the leader, focusing more on stability and profitability than on competing directly for a larger market share. They avoid innovation and risk.

- **d) Proposing a new product and its usage method to consumers in order to increase the total demand while maintaining or expanding the market share.**  
  
    This strategy is aligned with a **market leader**. Leaders focus on increasing total market demand by introducing innovations that expand the market while maintaining or even increasing their market share. They emphasize staying ahead through continuous improvement and new product development.

The correct answer is **d) Proposing a new product and its usage method to consumers in order to increase the total demand while maintaining or expanding the market share**, which is a characteristic of a **market leader's strategy**. Market leaders focus on expanding the total market while defending or growing their market share, typically through product innovation and leadership in their industry.
