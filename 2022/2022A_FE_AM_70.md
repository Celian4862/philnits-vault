Which of the following is a characteristic of MRP? 

**a) The development, designing, and production preparation of a product are performed simultaneously in parallel.** 

**b) The number of required components is calculated on the basis of the standard production plan of a product.** 

**c) The production of a product is initiated after an order from a customer is received.** 

**d) Work instructions and transport instructions are provided by using a worksheet.**
? 
**b) The number of required components is calculated on the basis of the standard production plan of a product.** 

## **Explanation:**

**MRP (Material Requirements Planning)** is a system for calculating the materials and components needed to manufacture a product. It determines the quantity and timing of production activities based on the **standard production plan**. It helps in efficiently planning inventory and ensuring that materials are available when needed.

### Brief Overview of Other Options:

- **a) The development, designing, and production preparation of a product are performed simultaneously in parallel** refers to **concurrent engineering**, not MRP.
- **c) The production of a product is initiated after an order from a customer is received** refers to a **make-to-order (MTO)** approach, which is different from MRP.
- **d) Work instructions and transport instructions are provided by using a worksheet** describes the **kanban** system in lean manufacturing, not MRP.

Therefore, the answer is **b) The number of required components is calculated on the basis of the standard production plan of a product.**
