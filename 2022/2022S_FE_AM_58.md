In IT service management, which of the following is the most appropriate functional
organization that provides a single point of contact and tries to rapidly restore normal service
operations to users?
a) Service desk
b) Service management
c) Service provider
d) Supplier 
? 
a) Service desk
## **Explanation:**

#### **IT Service Management (ITSM):**

IT Service Management (ITSM) involves how IT teams manage the end-to-end delivery of IT services to customers. This includes designing, creating, delivering, and supporting IT services. The core concept of ITSM is that IT should be delivered as a service, emphasizing a holistic approach to managing workplace technology.
#### **Key Functions of a Service Desk:**

1. **Incident Management**: Quickly resolving incidents to minimize downtime for users.
2. **Service Requests**: Handling requests for new services or information.
3. **Communication**: Acting as a channel for users to report issues and receive updates.

- **a) Service desk**: Correct! The service desk is specifically designed to provide a centralized contact point for users, managing incidents and service requests to restore operations efficiently.

- **b) Service management**: While it encompasses the entire ITSM framework, it does not function as a direct contact point for users.

- **c) Service provider**: The service provider refers to the organization delivering IT services but does not serve as the immediate contact for incident resolution.

- **d) Supplier**: A supplier provides resources or services but does not interact directly with users for incident management.

The **service desk** serves as the most appropriate functional organization for providing a single point of contact and rapidly restoring service operations. The correct answer is **a) Service desk**.
