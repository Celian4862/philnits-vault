When the estimated probabilities for the number of units that are sold per day for a product are as listed in the table below and the profit per unit is 10 dollars, what is the number of purchased units where the expected value for profit becomes a maximum? Here, a disposal loss of 3 dollars per unit is incurred if the product remains unsold on the day it was purchased.

**a) 4** 

**b) 5** 

**c) 6** 

**d) 7**
? 
**c) 6** 

## **Explanation:**

To determine the number of purchased units that maximizes the expected value for profit, we need to calculate the expected profit for each number of purchased units based on the provided probabilities and the profit/loss structure.

### Profit Calculation:

- **Profit per sold unit** = $10
- **Loss per unsold unit** = $3

### Expected Profit Calculation:

Let's compute the expected profit for each scenario of purchased units (4, 5, 6, and 7).

#### 1. Purchased Units = 4

- Sold Units = 4 (100% probability)
- Profit = $4 \text{ units} \times 10 \text{ dollars} = 40 \text{ dollars}$

**Expected Profit** = $40
#### 2. Purchased Units = 5

- Sold Units:
    - 4 units (30% probability): Profit = $4 \times 10-3 = 37\text{ dollars}$
    - 5 units (70% probability): Profit = $5 \times 10 = 50~\text{dollars}$

$\text{Expected Profit} = 0.30 \times 37 + 0.70 \times 50 = 11.1 + 35 = 46.1 \text{ dollars}$

#### 3. Purchased Units = 6

- Sold Units:
    - 4 units (30% probability): Profit = $4 \times 10 - 2 \times 3 = 40 - 6 = 34~\text{dollars}$
    - 5 units (30% probability): Profit = $5~ \times~10-3=47~\text{dollars}$
    - 6 units (40% probability): Profit = $6~\times~10=60~\text{dollars}$
$\text{Expected Profit}=0.30~\times~34+0.30~\times~47+0.40~\times~60=10.2+14.1+24=48.3~\text{dollars}$
#### 4. Purchased Units = 7

- Sold Units:
    - 4 units (30% probability): Profit = $4 \times 10 - 3 \times 3 = 40 - 9 = 31~\text{dollars}$
    - 5 units (30% probability): Profit = $5 \times 10 - 2 \times 3 = 50 - 6 = 44~\text{dollars}$
    - 6 units (30% probability): Profit = $6 \times 10 - 1 \times 3 = 60 - 3 = 57~\text{dollars}$
    - 7 units (10% probability): Profit = $7 \times 10 = 70~\text{dollars}$
    
$\text{Expected Profit}=0.30×31+0.30×44+0.30×57+0.10×70 =9.3+13.2+17.1+7=46.6  \text{ dollars}$

#### Summary of Expected Profits:

- Purchased 4 units: $40
- Purchased 5 units: $46.1
- Purchased 6 units: $48.3
- Purchased 7 units: $46.6

### **Conclusion**:
The maximum expected profit occurs when purchasing **6 units**, with an expected profit of **$48.3**. Therefore, the answer is **c)**.
