Which of the following is an appropriate description of the mapping between a relational model and relational database as its implementation?

**a) A domain is mapped to a character type or a character string type.** 

**b) A relation is mapped to a table.** 

**c) Attributes and columns are ordered from left to right.** 

**d) Neither tuples nor rows have duplicates.**
? 
**b) A relation is mapped to a table.**

## **Explanation:**

In relational databases, a **relation** in the relational model is implemented as a **table**. A relation represents a set of tuples, and a table holds rows of data that correspond to those tuples. Therefore, **b)** is correct.

**a)** This is incorrect because a domain in a relational model refers to the set of possible values an attribute can take. It can be mapped to various data types, not just character or string types (it could also be integers, floats, etc.).

**c)** This is incorrect because attributes (columns) in a relation are **unordered**. Their physical placement (left to right) in a table doesn't affect their meaning or the integrity of the relation.

**d)** This is incorrect for rows in a relational database. While in theory, a relation should not have duplicate tuples, many relational databases allow duplicate rows unless constraints like **primary keys** or **unique constraints** are explicitly enforced.
