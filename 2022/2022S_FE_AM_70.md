**c) Temperature sensor for equipment**
## **Explanation:**

#### **IoT in Predictive Maintenance:**

The **Internet of Things (IoT)** refers to the network of interconnected devices that communicate and exchange data over the internet. These devices are embedded with sensors, software, and other technologies that enable them to collect and share information. In industrial settings, such as factories, IoT devices can be employed for **predictive maintenance**â€”a strategy aimed at improving equipment reliability and minimizing downtime.

In the context of predictive maintenance tasks, the IoT system typically involves three main components:

1. **Data Collection**: Devices gather data from the equipment, such as temperature, vibration, or operational metrics, to monitor performance.
2. **Data Transmission**: This data is sent to a centralized system or cloud platform for further processing.
3. **Data Analysis and Utilization**: The received data is analyzed to identify patterns or anomalies that could indicate potential failures, allowing for timely interventions.

The provided question illustrates this process by listing basic elements of IoT systems along with their corresponding examples of devices and services.
## **Checking:**

|   Basic Element   | Example of Device and Service |
| :---------------: | :---------------------------: |
|  Data collection  |               A               |
| Data transmission |               B               |
|   Data analysis   |               C               |
| Data utilization  |               D               |

- a) Abnormal value judgment tool
- b) Display for work instructions
- c) Temperature sensor for equipment
- d) Wireless communication within the factory


1. **Data Collection (A)**:

    - Data Collection corresponds to **c) Temperature sensor for equipment**. In an industrial IoT context, a temperature sensor collects real-time data about the operational state of machines. By monitoring the temperature, companies can detect anomalies that might indicate potential failures before they occur.

3. **Data Transmission (B)**:

    - Data Transmission corresponds to **d) Wireless communication within the factory**. This component involves sending the collected data from the sensors to a central processing unit or cloud system where it can be analyzed. Wireless communication is crucial for enabling IoT devices to send data efficiently without requiring wired connections.

4. **Data Analysis (C)**:

    - Data analysis corresponds to **a) Abnormal value judgment tool**. After data is transmitted, it needs to be analyzed to identify any irregularities or potential maintenance needs. This tool can use algorithms to determine whether the data collected indicates normal operational parameters or if an alert should be raised based on abnormal values.

5. **Data Utilization (D)**:

    - Data utilization corresponds to **b) Display for work instructions**. Once the data is analyzed, the insights gained are utilized to inform decision-making processes, such as creating maintenance schedules or adjusting operations based on equipment status. A display for work instructions could relay crucial information to operators on the shop floor, ensuring that actions are taken based on the data insights.

 The answer **c) Temperature sensor for equipment** correctly corresponds to **A (Data Collection)**, highlighting its role as the first step in an effective IoT predictive maintenance strategy.
