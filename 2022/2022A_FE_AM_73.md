A smart meter is a highly functional electricity meter with a function for communications and a function for the management of other devices. Which of the following is not appropriate as the purpose of installing a smart meter? 

**a) Continuing the power supply for a fixed amount of time by functioning as an auxiliary power source at the time of a power failure** 

**b) Improving the efficiency of meter reading work through automatic meter reading** 

**c) Increasing awareness of power-saving through visualization of the amount of power consumption** 

**d) Restraining peak power through control over power demand by using demand response**
? 
**a) Continuing the power supply for a fixed amount of time by functioning as an auxiliary power source at the time of a power failure** 

## **Explanation:**

The purpose of installing a **smart meter** primarily revolves around **enhancing energy management**, improving **meter reading efficiency**, and **empowering consumers** to monitor their energy usage. However, smart meters do not serve as auxiliary power sources; their main function is to measure energy consumption and communicate data back to the utility. They do not provide backup power during outages.

### Brief Overview of Other Options:

- **b) Improving the efficiency of meter reading work through automatic meter reading** is a core function of smart meters, which enables utilities to read meters remotely and reduce labor costs.
- **c) Increasing awareness of power-saving through visualization of the amount of power consumption** is another purpose, as smart meters often provide consumers with real-time data on their energy usage.
- **d) Restraining peak power through control over power demand by using demand response** is a valid purpose, as smart meters can facilitate demand response programs to help manage peak energy loads.

Therefore, the answer is **a) Continuing the power supply for a fixed amount of time by functioning as an auxiliary power source at the time of a power failure.**
