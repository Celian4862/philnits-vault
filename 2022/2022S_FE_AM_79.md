a) Balance sheet
## **Explanation:**

#### **Financial Statements and Their Purpose:**

A company's **financial statements** provide a detailed view of its financial performance and health. There are four main types of financial statements, each serving a specific purpose:

1. **Balance Sheet**: Provides a snapshot of a company's financial position at a specific point in time, showing its **assets**, **liabilities**, and **shareholder equity**. This helps to determine what the company owns and owes at a particular moment, and gives an understanding of the company's financial stability.

2. **Income Statement (Profit or Loss Statement)**: Details a company's financial performance over a period of time, showing **revenues**, **expenses**, and whether it has made a profit or loss.

3. **Statement of Cash Flows**: Tracks the movement of cash in and out of the company, detailing its ability to generate cash and fund its operations.

4. **Statement of Changes in Equity**: Reflects changes in the company's equity (ownership interest) during a period, including retained earnings and shareholder contributions.

### **Balance Sheet:**

- **Assets**: What the company owns (e.g., cash, inventory, equipment).
- **Liabilities**: What the company owes (e.g., loans, accounts payable).
- **Shareholder Equity**: The residual value of the company after liabilities are deducted from assets.

#### **Answer Choices:**

- **a) Balance sheet**  
    This is the correct answer. A **balance sheet** shows the company’s **assets**, **liabilities**, and **net assets (shareholder equity)** at a specific point in time, providing insight into the company’s financial situation. It adheres to the accounting equation:
    $$Assets=Liabilities+Shareholder  Equity$$

- **b) Statement of cash flows**  

    This statement tracks the company's cash inflows and outflows over time. It is used to assess cash generation but doesn’t provide a detailed view of assets and liabilities at a point in time.

- **c) Statement of changes in equity**  

    This statement focuses on changes in equity over a period, such as dividends or retained earnings, rather than giving a comprehensive picture of assets and liabilities.

- **d) Statement of profit or loss (Income Statement)**  

    This statement shows the company's financial performance over a period, detailing revenues, expenses, and net income or loss, but it doesn’t show assets, liabilities, or net equity.

The correct answer is **a) Balance sheet**, which is the financial statement that shows the company's **assets, liabilities, and net assets** at a specific point in time.
