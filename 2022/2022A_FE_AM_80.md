Which of the following is an appropriate description of the scope of software protection under WTOâ€™s Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS)? 

**a) Algorithms and programming languages are protected.** 

**b) Application programs are protected but system programs such as an OS are not, as the value of the right is included in the hardware cost.** 

**c) Both source programs and object programs are protected.** 

**d) Documents that describe algorithms are protected, but programs created by using the algorithms are not.**
? 
**c) Both source programs and object programs are protected.** 

## **Explanation:**

Under the WTO's Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS), **software protection includes both source code and object code**. This means that both the high-level language (source code) and the compiled form (object code) of software are protected as literary works. The TRIPS agreement establishes a framework for intellectual property rights, ensuring that member countries provide adequate protection for various forms of software.

### Overview of Other Options:

- **a)** **Algorithms and programming languages are protected**: This is not accurate, as TRIPS focuses on the protection of the software itself rather than the underlying algorithms or languages.
- **b)** **Application programs are protected but system programs such as an OS are not**: This is incorrect, as both types of programs are generally protected under TRIPS.
- **d)** **Documents that describe algorithms are protected, but programs created by using the algorithms are not**: This is also incorrect, as the actual programs (source and object) are protected under TRIPS.

Therefore, the answer is **c)**.
