Which of the following is the most appropriate purpose for which a system auditor exchanges opinions with an audited department concerning the draft version of an audit report? 

**a) To confirm that there are no factual errors in the findings and recommendations to be described in the audit report** 

**b) To issue the audit report to the audited department before the audit report is submitted to the person who is requesting the audit** 

**c) To receive the approval of the responsible person of the audited department concerning the recommendations described in the audit report** 

**d) To substitute with additional auditing activities concerning the part of the audit report for which evidence is insufficient by orally confirming with the audited department**
? 
**a) To confirm that there are no factual errors in the findings and recommendations to be described in the audit report**

## **Explanation:**

During the audit process, it is essential to ensure the accuracy of the findings and recommendations. By exchanging opinions with the audited department on the draft report, the auditor can verify that the information presented is correct and that there are no misunderstandings or misinterpretations. This step helps to maintain the integrity of the audit process and ensures that the final report reflects an accurate assessment of the department's operations.

### Brief Overview of Other Options:

- **b)** While sharing the draft may happen, the main purpose is not to issue it prior to submission but to ensure accuracy and clarity.
- **c)** While obtaining approval may be a goal, it is not the primary purpose of discussing the draft; auditors typically seek feedback rather than formal approval.
- **d)** Substituting additional auditing activities is not appropriate; auditors should gather sufficient evidence before concluding, rather than relying on oral confirmation for parts of the report.

In summary, the correct answer is **a) To confirm that there are no factual errors in the findings and recommendations to be described in the audit report.**
