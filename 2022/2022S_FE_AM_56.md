## **Explanation:**

#### **Service Level Agreements (SLA):**

An SLA is a contract between a service provider and their clients/customers. This agreement provides all the information and details regarding the products and services that the service provider must provide to their customers or clients which includes **availability**. Availability is the percentage of time the service must be operational during defined hours. 

$$
\text{Availability (\%)} = \frac{\text{Uptime}}{\text{Total Service Time}} \times 100
$$

A service with 99% availability allows a small amount of downtime, typically 1% of the total service time, which we need to calculate.

#### **Calculating Total Service Time:**

The question gives us the following conditions:
1. The service operates **16 hours per day** (from 7 AM to 11 PM).
2. There are **30 business days per month**.

To find the **total service hours**, we multiply the hours per day by the number of days:

$$ Total\: Service\: Hours = 16 \: hours/day \times 30 \: days = 480 \: hours $$

#### **Downtime Calculation:**

Since the agreed availability is **99%**, downtime is allowed to be 1% of the total service time. We calculate the downtime as follows:

$$ Maximum\: Downtime = 1\% \: of \: 480 \: hours = \frac{1}{100} \times 480 = 4.8 \: hours $$

### **Conclusion:**

The maximum number of hours of downtime that satisfies the SLA is **4.8 hours**.
