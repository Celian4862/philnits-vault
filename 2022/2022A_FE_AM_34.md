Which of the following is a global IPv4 address?

**a) 10.10.10.10** 

**b) 129.10.9.7** 

**c) 172.16.1.5** 

**d) 192.168.20.3**
? 
**b) 129.10.9.7** 

## **Explanation:**

**Global IP addresses** are used on the public internet and are unique across the globe, whereas **private IP addresses** are used within local networks and are not routable on the public internet.

- **10.10.10.10**: This belongs to the private IP address range **10.0.0.0 - 10.255.255.255**.
- **172.16.1.5**: This is part of the private IP address range **172.16.0.0 - 172.31.255.255**.
- **192.168.20.3**: This is part of the private IP address range **192.168.0.0 - 192.168.255.255**.
- **129.10.9.7**: This is a public (global) IP address because it does not fall within any of the private IP address ranges.
Therefore, the answer is **b)**.
