Which of the following is an appropriate purpose for using a WBS (work breakdown structure) in a software development project? 

**a) To clarify the time sequence of activities and understand the critical path that should be intensively managed** 

**b) To decompose a development task into smaller sub-tasks with a manageable size and organize them into a hierarchical structure** 

**c) To optimize the total cost when there is a trade-off relationship between the number of days and the costs required for development** 

**d) To show the schedule of activities by using bars and clarify the start dates and end dates of the activities as well as the progress at the current point**
? 
**b) To decompose a development task into smaller sub-tasks with a manageable size and organize them into a hierarchical structure** 

## **Explanation:**

The **Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)** is a key project management tool that breaks down a project into smaller, more manageable components or tasks. This hierarchical decomposition allows for better planning, monitoring, and control of the project. It helps in organizing the work, defining the scope, and establishing a clear structure for assigning responsibilities.

### Brief Overview of Other Options:

- **a)** This describes scheduling and critical path analysis, which are more relevant to the project schedule management rather than the purpose of a WBS.
- **c)** While cost optimization is important in project management, it is not the primary purpose of a WBS, which focuses on task decomposition.
- **d)** This describes a Gantt chart, which is used for scheduling activities, showing start and end dates, rather than the hierarchical breakdown of tasks.

In summary, the correct answer is **b) To decompose a development task into smaller sub-tasks with a manageable size and organize them into a hierarchical structure.**
