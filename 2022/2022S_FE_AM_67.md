## **Explanation:**

#### **Product Life Cycle Overview:**

The **product life cycle** is a concept used in marketing and business strategy that describes the stages a product goes through from its introduction to its eventual decline in the market. This helps companies make decisions related to pricing, advertising, product improvements, and market positioning. The four key stages are **Introduction, Growth, Maturity,** and **Decline**.

#### **Stages of the Product Life Cycle:**

1. **Introduction Stage:**
    - This is the launch phase when the product is introduced to the market for the first time.
    - Key characteristics include **low sales**, **high marketing costs**, and **uncertain profitability**.
    - Companies invest heavily in **advertising** to build **product awareness** among early adopters and the general market.

2. **Growth Stage:**
    - If the product gains traction, it enters the growth phase, where **sales increase** rapidly, and the market becomes more aware of the product.
    - Competitors often enter the market at this stage, intensifying competition. Companies may still invest in marketing but focus more on **differentiating** their product from rivals.

3. **Maturity Stage:**
    - The product reaches peak market penetration during the maturity stage. Sales **stabilize**, and growth slows down.
    - Competition is at its highest during this phase, and companies focus on **maintaining market share**, often through **product improvements** or **pricing strategies**.

4. **Decline Stage:**
    - In the decline stage, the product's sales begin to fall due to **market saturation** or **changing consumer preferences**.
    - Companies often scale back marketing and may either phase out the product or invest in updates or newer versions.

The question asks about the **Introduction Stage** of the product life cycle. This is the stage where the product is first launched in the market, and companies need to focus on **building product recognition** among potential customers.

## **Checking:**

- **a) "It is the stage at which companies sell products to early adopters. Companies adopt strategies to enhance product recognition."**
    
    - **Correct**: This is an accurate description of the **Introduction Stage**. In this stage, companies focus on selling the product to **early adopters** and spend heavily on marketing to **build awareness**.

- **b) "It is the stage at which growth in demand slows. Companies try to maintain their market share and secure profits through various means, such as improving product quality."**
    
    - This describes the **Maturity Stage**, where the market is saturated, and companies work to maintain their position and profitability by improving product quality.

- **c) "It is the stage at which sales and profit gradually decline. Companies refrain from making additional investments and consider withdrawing from the market."**
    
    - This refers to the **Decline Stage**, where sales drop, and companies often scale back on marketing or consider phasing out the product.

- **d) "It is the stage at which sales increase rapidly. The market becomes active and competition intensifies because of new market participants."**
    
    - This describes the **Growth Stage**, where the product is gaining popularity, sales increase, and competitors start to enter the market.

The correct answer is **A)** because it accurately reflects the characteristics of the **Introduction Stage** of the product life cycle. In this stage, the focus is on **building product awareness** and selling to **early adopters** while incurring high marketing costs.
