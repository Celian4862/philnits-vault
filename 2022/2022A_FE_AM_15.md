An information processing system consists of a database and web server with the specifications shown in the table below:

When the throughput of an entire processing system is determined by the throughput of the server with the lowest throughput, what is the throughput of the entire processing system in TPS (transactions per second)? Here, the throughput of a server is calculated by multiplying the number of transactions in a second with the upper limit of CPU utilization. A database and web server perform the processing independently, and there is one CPU in each server.

**a) 160**

**b) 225**

**c) 250**

**d) 385**
? 
**a) 160**
## **Explanation:**

To calculate the throughput of the database server in transactions per second (TPS), use the following formula:
#### $Throughput~(TPS)=\frac{1}{Processing~time~per~transaction~(in~seconds)}~\cdot~CPU~utilization$
First, convert milliseconds to seconds
#### $1~ms=0.001~secs$

### **Calculate the throughput of the database and the web server:**
#### $Throughput~(Database)=\frac{1}{0.005~secs}~\cdot~80\%=160~TPS$

#### $Throughput~(Web~Server)=\frac{1}{0.004~secs}~\cdot~90\%=225~TPS$

### **Conclusion:**
The throughput of the entire processing system is determined by the server with the **lowest throughput**, which in this case is the **database server** with **160 TPS**. Therefore, the throughput of the entire processing system is **160 TPS**, so the correct answer is: **a) 160**.
