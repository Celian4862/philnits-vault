When trial production is performed for components to be loaded into electrical appliances, which of the following is the least expensive development method? Here, the construction time of each process is six (6) months for the creation process, three (3) months for the modification process, and two (2) months for the evaluation process. The cost per one (1) person-month is 6,000 dollars for the creation process and 10,000 dollars for each of the modification and evaluation processes. Costs other than the purchase cost, outsourcing cost, and person-month cost shall not be considered.

## **Explanation:**

To calculate the total cost for each development method, we need to account for the **purchase cost**, **outsourcing cost**, and the **person-month costs** for each process (creation, modification, and evaluation). Here's the breakdown:

1. **a) Purchasing samples and modifying them in-house:**
    
    - Purchase cost: **200,000** dollars
    - Outsourcing cost: **0** dollars
    - Modification process: **4 persons × 3 months × 10,000 dollars = 120,000** dollars
    - Evaluation process: **1 person × 2 months × 10,000 dollars = 20,000** dollars
    - **Total cost = 200,000 + 120,000 + 20,000 = 340,000 dollars**
2. **b) Outsourcing in batches:**
    
    - Purchase cost: **0** dollars
    - Outsourcing cost: **350,000** dollars
    - No other costs.
    - **Total cost = 350,000 dollars**
3. **c) Modifying in-house assets:**
    
    - Purchase cost: **0** dollars
    - Outsourcing cost: **0** dollars
    - Modification process: **10 persons × 3 months × 10,000 dollars = 300,000** dollars
    - Evaluation process: **3 persons × 2 months × 10,000 dollars = 60,000** dollars
    - **Total cost = 300,000 + 60,000 = 360,000 dollars**
4. **d) Creating new products in-house:**
    
    - Purchase cost: **0** dollars
    - Outsourcing cost: **0** dollars
    - Creation process: **10 persons × 6 months × 6,000 dollars = 360,000** dollars
    - Evaluation process: **2 persons × 2 months × 10,000 dollars = 40,000** dollars
    - **Total cost = 360,000 + 40,000 = 400,000 dollars**

### **Conclusion:** 
The least expensive option is **a) Purchasing samples and modifying them in-house** with a total cost of **340,000 dollars**.
