Which of the following can secure employment and create employment opportunities across an entire society by shortening work hours per employee?
a) Cafeteria plan
b) Free agent system
c) Work sharing
d) Work-life balance
? 
c) Work sharing
## **Explanation:**

#### **What is Work Sharing?**

**Work sharing** is a way to protect or create jobs by reducing the number of hours each employee works. Instead of laying people off when there is less work, companies can lower the work hours for everyone and spread the available work among more employees. This helps keep more people employed, even if they work fewer hours. Sometimes, the government helps by providing financial support to make up for the lower wages workers get due to shorter hours.

For example, during tough economic times, a company might cut the workweek from 40 to 30 hours per employee but keep all their workers, instead of firing some of them. This way, more people have jobs, and the company avoids the cost of hiring and training new workers when the economy improves.

## **Checking:**

- **a) Cafeteria plan**: This is a type of employee benefits program where workers can choose benefits, like health insurance or retirement plans. It doesn’t affect work hours or create jobs.

- **b) Free agent system**: This means people work independently or as freelancers, choosing their own jobs. While this gives flexibility to workers, it doesn’t help create jobs for a whole society.

- **c) Work sharing**: Correct! Work sharing reduces each person’s work hours to spread available work across more employees. This helps keep or create jobs for more people.

- **d) Work-life balance**: This focuses on making sure people have time for both work and personal life. While important, it doesn’t directly create more jobs.


So, **c) Work sharing** is the right answer because it helps protect and create jobs by reducing work hours and sharing the available work among more people.
