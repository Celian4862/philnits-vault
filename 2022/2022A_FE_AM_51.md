A project consisting of several activities has a single critical path. Which of the following is an appropriate description of critical path activities for the project? 

**a) Critical path activities can be performed in parallel.** 

**b) Critical path activities have a non-zero total float time.** 

**c) For each critical path activity, the early start date equals the late start date.** 

**d) The activity with the longest duration in the project is one of the critical path activities.**
? 
**c) For each critical path activity, the early start date equals the late start date.** 

## **Explanation:**

In project management, critical path activities are those that directly impact the overall project duration. The key characteristics of critical path activities include:

- They have zero total float (or slack), meaning any delay in these activities will directly delay the project.
- The early start date (the earliest time an activity can start) is equal to the late start date (the latest time an activity can start without delaying the project).

### Brief Overview of Other Options:

- **a)** Critical path activities cannot be performed in parallel if they are sequential; they must be completed in a specific order to maintain the critical path.
- **b)** Critical path activities have zero total float, not non-zero. Non-zero total float indicates that there is flexibility in the schedule, which does not apply to critical path activities.
- **d)** While an activity with the longest duration may be part of the critical path, it is not necessarily true that it will always be a critical path activity. The critical path is determined by the sequence of dependent activities that dictate the project's total duration, not just the longest activity.

In summary, the correct answer is **c) For each critical path activity, the early start date equals the late start date.**
