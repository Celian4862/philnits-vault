# 2022A_FE_AM_75 %% ex. 2024S_FE-A_83 %%

Which of the following is a management organization that has the characteristic of both project and functional organizations being able to flexibly respond to changes in the business environment? 

**a) Divisional organization** 

**b) Hierarchical organization** 

**c) Line and staff organization**

**d) Matrix organization**
? 
**d) Matrix organization**

## **Explanation:**

A **matrix organization** combines elements of both **project** and **functional** organizational structures. It allows for flexibility and efficient resource allocation by creating cross-functional teams that can respond quickly to changes in the business environment. Employees typically report to both a functional manager and a project manager, facilitating collaboration and adaptability.

### Overview of Other Options:

- **a)** **Divisional organization**: Divides the organization into semi-autonomous units or divisions, usually based on products, services, or geographical locations, but lacks the dual reporting structure of a matrix.
- **b)** **Hierarchical organization**: Features a clear chain of command and levels of authority but is often rigid and slow to respond to changes due to its structured nature.
- **c)** **Line and staff organization**: Combines direct line authority with specialized staff services, providing a more traditional structure that may not be as flexible as a matrix organization.

Therefore, the answer is **d)**.
