## **Explanation:**

The `ALTER TABLE` command with the `DROP COLUMN` clause is the standard SQL syntax for removing a column from an existing table. Therefore, the answer is **b)**.

**a)** This is incorrect. SQL does not use the `DELETE COLUMN` syntax for removing a column.

**c)** This is incorrect. The `UPDATE` command is used to modify data in existing rows, not to alter the structure of a table. There is no `DELETE COLUMN` syntax in SQL.

**d)** This is incorrect. Similar to option **c**, the `UPDATE` command is not used for altering table structure, and `DROP COLUMN` cannot be used with `UPDATE`.
