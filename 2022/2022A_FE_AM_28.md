Which of the following is the purpose of setting an index in the columns of the table of a relational database?

**a) To enable efficient access to the storage location of data so that the search speed can be improved** 

**b) To ensure that no value is duplicated in a column** 

**c) To match the value of the column of the foreign key with the value of the primary key of another table** 

**d) To save disk space when a single large table is distributed and saved on several disks**
? 
**a) To enable efficient access to the storage location of data so that the search speed can be improved** 

## **Explanation:**

An index is used to improve the performance of data retrieval operations by allowing the database to locate rows more quickly, thus improving the search speed. Since **a**) accurately describes the purpose of setting an index, it is correct.

**b)** This is incorrect. While unique constraints or primary keys ensure that no value is duplicated, this is not the purpose of setting an index. An index may be created on unique columns, but it doesn't ensure uniqueness on its own.

**c)** This is incorrect. Foreign key constraints are used to maintain referential integrity between tables, not indexes. Indexes are primarily focused on speeding up data retrieval.

**d)** This is incorrect. Indexes typically do not save disk space; they actually consume additional disk space because they store a separate data structure for faster access. Partitioning is the mechanism used to distribute a large table across multiple disks, not indexing.
