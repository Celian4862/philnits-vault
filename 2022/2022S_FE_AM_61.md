Which of the following is an explanation of enterprise architecture (EA)?
a) It is a technique to abstract and express business processes with the four (4) basic elements of data flow, process, file, and data sources and absorption.
b) It is a technique to analyze each business operation and information system through the four (4) systems of business, data, application, and technology, and reexamine it from the viewpoint of total optimization.
c) It is a technique to analyze or design a system by using schematic diagrams such as a class diagram, and it is developed by integrating and standardizing various methods that support an object-oriented design.
d) It is a technique to clarify the data structure and the relationship between data items by expressing the conceptual data model with entities and relationships.
? 
b) It is a technique to analyze each business operation and information system through the four (4) systems of business, data, application, and technology, and reexamine it from the viewpoint of total optimization.
## **Explanation:**

#### **Enterprise Architecture (EA) Overview:**

Enterprise architecture (EA) is a conceptual framework that defines the structure and operation of an organization. It integrates business processes, data, applications, and technology to ensure that the organization can meet its current and future goals. EA helps businesses align their strategies with technology and optimize organizational efficiency by analyzing, planning, and implementing processes and systems.

The question asks for the correct explanation of **enterprise architecture (EA)**, focusing on its core concepts related to the alignment of business and IT systems for optimization.

- **a) It is a technique to abstract and express business processes with the four (4) basic elements of data flow, process, file, and data sources and absorption.**  
  This describes **data flow modeling**, not enterprise architecture. EA is broader and involves aligning the entire organizationâ€™s operations, not just business processes and data flows.

- **b) It is a technique to analyze each business operation and information system through the four (4) systems of business, data, application, and technology, and reexamine it from the viewpoint of total optimization.**  
  This answer aligns closely with the core concepts of EA, which includes analyzing business, data, applications, and technology systems to ensure that all areas of the organization are optimized.

- **c) It is a technique to analyze or design a system by using schematic diagrams such as a class diagram, and it is developed by integrating and standardizing various methods that support an object-oriented design.**  
  This answer refers to **object-oriented design** and **UML diagrams**, which are techniques used in systems and software design, not enterprise architecture.

- **d) It is a technique to clarify the data structure and the relationship between data items by expressing the conceptual data model with entities and relationships.**  
  This describes **entity-relationship (ER) modeling**, which is focused on data structure design, not the comprehensive approach of EA that integrates multiple systems and business operations.

The correct explanation of enterprise architecture is **b) It is a technique to analyze each business operation and information system through the four (4) systems of business, data, application, and technology, and reexamine it from the viewpoint of total optimization**. This captures the holistic approach of EA in aligning and optimizing various organizational components for improved efficiency and performance.
