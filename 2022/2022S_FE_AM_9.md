### What is binary search?
- a [search algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_algorithm "Search algorithm") that finds the position of a target value within a [sorted array](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sorted_array "Sorted array")

#### A) A binary search is always faster than a linear search:
- On cases where the element is near the start of where the linear search happens, it would find the element faster than a binary search.

#### B) In a binary search, searching starts from the beginning of the data:
- Binary search starts comparing at the middle

#### C) The data upon which the binary search is to be performed must be sorted
- This is true as one of the properties of binary search is it must be applied to a sorted set

#### D) The number of comparisons that need to be performed during the search is proportional to $log_2$N, where N is the number of data items
- This statement is true, but it describes an **attribute** of the efficiency of binary search, not a fundamental condition for its operation. The logarithmic time complexity is important, but it only holds if the data is already sorted, as described in **c)**.
