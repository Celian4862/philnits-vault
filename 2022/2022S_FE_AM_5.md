### We can find the correct answer by running each option against the state transition table.

For all options, Initial state = A

Option A:  
Next character = + (Sign), State = C  
Next character = 0, State = B  
Next character = 0, State = B  
Next character = 1, State = B  
Next character = 0, State = B

Option B:
Next character = – (Sign), State = C  
Next character = 1, State = B

Option C:  
Next character = 1, State = B  
Next character = 2, State = B  
Next character = . (Radix point), State = D  
Next character = 2, State = E, FAIL

Option D:
Next character = 9, State = B  
Next character = . (Radix point), State = D  
Next character = Δ (Space), State = A
