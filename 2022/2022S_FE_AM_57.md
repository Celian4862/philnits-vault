In the capacity management process of IT service management, which of the following is an appropriate precaution to observe when the utilization of an online systemâ€™s capacity is monitored?
a) Focus only on the maximum value of performance data in each time interval and check deviation from the management limit.
b) Measure the performance during offline hours to avoid a decline in service level during online hours.
c) Monitor multiple measurement items such as response time and CPU utilization on a regular basis.
d) Record incidents concerning capacity and performance.
? 
c) Monitor multiple measurement items such as response time and CPU utilization on a regular basis.
## **Explanation:**

#### **Capacity Management in IT Service Management:**

Capacity management is a critical process within **IT service management (ITSM)** that ensures IT resources are used efficiently to meet both current and future business needs. Effective capacity management prevents performance degradation by ensuring that system utilization stays within acceptable limits.

#### **Key Performance Metrics:**

Monitoring system capacity involves tracking several performance metrics, including:

1. **CPU Utilization**: The percentage of processing power being used by the system.
2. **Response Time**: The time it takes for the system to respond to user inputs.
3. **Memory Usage**: The amount of memory consumed by running processes.

#### **Regular Monitoring:**

To prevent performance issues, it's important to continuously monitor these metrics during both peak usage times (online hours) and under typical load conditions. This helps ensure that systems remain responsive and within operational thresholds.

- **a) Focus only on the maximum value of performance data in each time interval and check deviation from the management limit.**  
    This is not recommended because focusing only on peak values doesn't provide a comprehensive view of system behavior over time. It may miss trends or gradual degradations in performance.

- **b) Measure the performance during offline hours to avoid a decline in service level during online hours.**  
    Measuring performance during offline hours doesn't reflect actual load conditions. It is important to measure system performance when it's under real usage to get an accurate picture of how it handles peak loads.

- **c) Monitor multiple measurement items such as response time and CPU utilization on a regular basis.**  
    Correct! Regularly monitoring multiple key metrics like response time and CPU utilization ensures that system performance is maintained and that issues can be detected early.

- **d) Record incidents concerning capacity and performance.**  
	Recording incidents is important, but it's a reactive step. Proactively monitoring performance helps prevent incidents from occurring in the first place.

The correct precaution in capacity management is to **monitor multiple key metrics such as response time and CPU utilization on a regular basis** to ensure that the system remains stable under real-world usage.  This makes **c) Monitor multiple measurement items such as response time and CPU utilization on a regular basis** the correct answer.
