The software reengineering process can be divided into four sub-processes: program modularization, program structure improvement, reverse engineering, and source code translation. Which of the following is a process that focuses on functional analysis and information extraction?
a) Program modularization
b) Program structure improvement
c) Reverse engineering 
d) Source code translation
? 
c) Reverse engineering
## **Explanation:**

### **What is Software Re-Engineering?**

A systematic process aimed at improving and maintaining existing software systems. It typically involves analyzing the current software structure, breaking it down into manageable modules, improving its organization, and sometimes converting or reinterpreting its source code.

Identify which sub-process specifically focuses on understanding the software's functionality by analyzing and extracting critical information from the system, without necessarily changing its behavior or purpose.

- A) Program modularization: Program modularization involves dividing a software system into smaller, more manageable modules. While it helps make the program easier to maintain and modify, it is not focused on functional analysis or extracting information from the system.
- B) Program structure improvement: This sub-process focuses on optimizing and simplifying the software’s structure for better performance and readability. However, it doesn't involve functional analysis or extracting the software’s design details, which is the main objective of reverse engineering.
- **C) Reverse engineering: Reverse engineering is the process of analyzing software to understand its design, functionality, and architecture by extracting detailed information from the existing code or system. It helps engineers understand the underlying logic and structure of the system without modifying it. This process is particularly useful when documentation is lacking or the original developers are unavailable, and it forms a crucial part of software reengineering.**
- D) Source code translation: Source code translation refers to converting code from one programming language to another while preserving the program’s functionality. This process is about transforming the code rather than extracting information about the system's functionality or architecture.
