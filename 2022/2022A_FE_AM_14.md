Which of the following is a memory device that stores programs or data in factories and only has the read operation for the stored programs or data?

**a) DRAM**

**b) Flash Memory**

**c) Mask ROM**

**d) SRAM**
? 
**c) Mask ROM**
## **Explanation:**

**Mask ROM** is a type of non-volatile memory that is programmed during the manufacturing process (in **factories**). Once the data or programs are written into **Mask ROM**, they cannot be altered or erased. The only operation allowed is **reading** the data. This is typically used for permanent data storage like firmware in devices. Therefore, **c** is the correct answer.

**a)  DRAM** is a type of volatile memory, meaning it requires power to maintain its data. It is used as the main memory in computers and can be both read and written to. DRAM is not pre-programmed and does not store data permanently.

**b) Flash memory** is non-volatile memory, meaning it retains data even when power is removed. It can be read and written to multiple times. It is commonly used in USB drives, SSDs, and memory cards. Flash memory can be rewritten, so it is not limited to the read operation.

**d) SRAM** is another type of volatile memory used in cache memory in computers. It can be read and written to, and it loses data when power is turned off. Like DRAM, it is not factory-programmed.
