Which of the following is an appropriate description of the Responsibility Assignment Matrix that is used for project human resource management? 

**a) Allocating work packages to those who are responsible for project work** 

**b) Defining the limits of the project sponsor’s responsibilities** 

**c) Defining the terms of reference of the project** 

**d) Monitoring the current engagement level of stakeholders**
? 
**a) Allocating work packages to those who are responsible for project work** 

## **Explanation:**

The **Responsibility Assignment Matrix (RAM)** is a tool used in project management to map the relationship between project activities (or work packages) and the individuals or roles responsible for completing them. It clarifies who is responsible, accountable, consulted, and informed (often summarized as RACI) for each task or deliverable within a project. This helps ensure clear ownership of tasks and facilitates communication among team members.

### Brief Overview of Other Options:

- **b)** While defining responsibilities is part of RAM, specifying the limits of a project sponsor’s responsibilities is not its primary function.
- **c)** Defining the terms of reference of the project is related to project initiation and governance but is not the focus of a RAM.
- **d)** Monitoring the current engagement level of stakeholders is related to stakeholder management but does not describe the function of a RAM.

In summary, the correct answer is **a) Allocating work packages to those who are responsible for project work.**
