Which of the following is an appropriate description for group decision-making techniques used in the estimation process of an activity duration? 

**a) The estimates created using these techniques may include contingency reserves, sometimes referred to as time reserves or buffers, in the project schedule to account for schedule uncertainty.** 

**b) These are team-based approaches, such as brainstorming, the Delphi, or nominal group techniques, which are useful for engaged team members to improve their estimation accuracy and commit to the estimates.** 

**c) These techniques use statistical relationships between historical data and project parameters to calculate an estimate for project cost, budget, or duration.** 

**d) Using these techniques, a group of experts, guided by historical information, can provide duration estimate information or recommended maximum activity durations from prior similar projects.**
? 
**b) These are team-based approaches, such as brainstorming, the Delphi, or nominal group techniques, which are useful for engaged team members to improve their estimation accuracy and commit to the estimates.** 

## **Explanation:**

Group decision-making techniques in estimation, such as **brainstorming, the Delphi method, and nominal group technique**, are designed to gather input from multiple team members to improve the accuracy of estimates. These collaborative approaches allow team members to share insights, consider diverse perspectives, and reach a consensus on duration estimates, leading to more reliable project planning.

### Brief Overview of Other Options:

- **a)** While contingency reserves may be included in project schedules, this statement does not specifically describe group decision-making techniques.
- **c)** This describes quantitative estimation methods (like parametric estimating), which are not focused on group decision-making.
- **d)** This refers to expert judgment and historical data analysis, which may not necessarily involve group decision-making techniques.

In summary, the correct answer is **b) These are team-based approaches, such as brainstorming, the Delphi, or nominal group techniques, which are useful for engaged team members to improve their estimation accuracy and commit to the estimates.**
