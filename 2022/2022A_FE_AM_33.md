Which of the following protocol supports the congestion control feature?

**a) ARP** 

**b) ICMP** 

**c) TCP** 

**d) UDP**
? 
**c) TCP** 

## **Explanation:**

**TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)** supports congestion control as part of its reliable data transfer mechanism. It adjusts the rate of data transmission based on network conditions to avoid overwhelming the network, using techniques like slow start, congestion avoidance, and fast recovery. Therefore, the answer is **c)**.

**a)** **ARP (Address Resolution Protocol)**: Used to map IP addresses to MAC addresses; does not deal with congestion control.

**c)** **ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol)**: Used for sending error messages and operational information, like "ping," but doesn't handle congestion control.

**d)** **UDP (User Datagram Protocol)**: A simpler, connectionless protocol that does not include congestion control mechanisms.
