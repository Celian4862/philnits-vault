Which of the following is the most appropriate explanation of augmented reality (AR)? 

**a) By appealing to the five senses through equipment, such as a head-mounted display, a person can experience locations or worlds that do not exist as if they were real.** 

**b) By constructing a 3D virtual space that is natural to humans and changing the virtual space in accordance with a personâ€™s movement, he or she can feel as if he or she were in that place.** 

**c) By seamlessly interweaving computer-generated information with the physical world, the viewer can perceive it as an immersive aspect of the real environment.** 

**d) By viewing a video recorded in the past, the viewer can feel as if he or she were in that era and at that location.**
? 
**c) By seamlessly interweaving computer-generated information with the physical world, the viewer can perceive it as an immersive aspect of the real environment.**

## **Explanation:**

**AR** overlays digital content onto the real world, allowing users to interact with both simultaneously. It creates an **immersive experience** by **blending the virtual and physical environments.** Choice **c)** accurately describes **AR** so it is correct.

**a)** Describes a virtual reality (VR) experience more than augmented reality. AR typically overlays digital information onto the real world rather than creating entirely new worlds.

**b)** This description also leans more toward virtual reality. While AR may involve spatial awareness, it doesn't create an entirely separate 3D space; rather, it enhances the existing physical space.

**d)** This statement does not accurately define augmented reality. It describes a viewing experience that is more akin to nostalgia or historical representation rather than the interactive overlay characteristic of AR.
