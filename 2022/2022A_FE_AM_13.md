There is a disk drive that has a capacity of 8 GB. The drive has five (5) platters with two (2) surfaces: 10,000 tracks per surface and 200 sectors per track. How many bytes are in each sector? Here, 1 GB is 1,000,000,000 bytes.

**a) 100**

**b) 200**

**c) 400**

**d) 800**
? 
**c) 400**
## **Explanation:**
To determine how many bytes are in each sector, we can break down the problem using the provided information and perform the following calculations:
### **Given:**
- Disk capacity: **8 GB** = 8,000,000,000 bytes (since 1 GB = 1,000,000,000 bytes)
- Number of platters: **5**
- Number of surfaces per platter: **2** (so there are $5~\cdot~2=10~surfaces$)
- Number of tracks per surface: **10,000**
- Number of sectors per track: **200**

### **Step-by-step calculation:**

#### **1. Calculate the total number of sectors on the disk:**
Each surface has:

	$10,000~tracks~\cdot~200~sectors~per~track=2,000,000~sectors~per~surface$
	
Since there are 10 surfaces:

	$2,000,000~sectors~per~surface~\cdot~10~surfaces=20,000,000~sectors$
#### **2. Calculate the number of bytes per sector:**

	$\frac{8,000,000,000~bytes}{20,000,000~sectors}=400~bytes~per~sector$
### **Conclusion:**
Each sector contains 400 bytes. Therefore, the answer is **c**.
