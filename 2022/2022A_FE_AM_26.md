In a relational database, which of the following is an appropriate purpose for defining a foreign key?

**a) To prevent fragmentation in the record storage area due to the repeated deletion and insertion of records** 

**b) To provide a constraint to maintain referential consistency between the records of related tables** 

**c) To restore as many records as possible when they are damaged by failure, based on the mutual relationship between tables** 

**d) To speed up the searching and updating of related tables by storing them closer together**
? 
**b) To provide a constraint to maintain referential consistency between the records of related tables**

## **Explanation:**

A foreign key is used to ensure that a relationship between two tables is consistent. It prevents actions that would break the link, such as inserting a record with a foreign key that doesn't exist in the related table or deleting a referenced record. Therefore, the appropriate purpose for defining a foreign key in a relational database is:

**b) To provide a constraint to maintain referential consistency between the records of related tables.**


**a)** This is incorrect. Preventing fragmentation in the storage area is typically handled by physical database maintenance activities, such as reindexing or database compaction, and is unrelated to the concept of foreign keys.

**c)** This is incorrect. Restoring records after failure is typically handled by backup and recovery systems, not by foreign key constraints.

**d)** This is incorrect. While related tables might benefit from optimization techniques (such as indexing), the foreign key constraint itself does not directly speed up searches or updates. Its primary role is to maintain referential integrity, not performance optimization.
