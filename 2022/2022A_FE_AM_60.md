Which of the following is the appropriate activity performed by a system auditor who audits access control? 

**a) Creating and storing the access control records for the software**

**b) Establishing an access control policy for the network** 

**c) Implementing the access control procedures for hardware** 

**d) Viewing the access control rules for data**
? 
**d) Viewing the access control rules for data**

## **Explanation:**

In the context of auditing access control, the system auditor's role involves examining and evaluating the effectiveness of the existing access control measures. This includes reviewing the access control rules that dictate how data can be accessed, by whom, and under what conditions. By viewing these rules, the auditor can assess whether they align with security policies and effectively protect sensitive data from unauthorized access.

### Brief Overview of Other Options:

- **a)** Creating and storing access control records is more of an operational task that falls under the responsibilities of system administrators or IT personnel rather than auditors.
- **b)** Establishing an access control policy is a governance activity typically performed by management or security personnel, not an auditor.
- **c)** Implementing access control procedures is also an operational task, focused on executing policies rather than auditing them.

In summary, the correct answer is **d) Viewing the access control rules for data.**
