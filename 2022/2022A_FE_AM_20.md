A half adder is a logic circuit that performs the addition of two single-bit binary numbers and outputs the sum and carry. The truth table of a half adder is shown in the table below. Which of the following is an appropriate logic diagram of the half adder?

## **Explanation:**

To design a half adder logic circuit based on the provided truth table, we can summarize the output conditions:

**Sum (S)**: This output is true (1) when exactly one of the inputs (A or B) is true. This can be expressed as the XOR operation:
#### $S = A\oplus B$

**Carry (C)**: This output is true (1) only when both inputs are true. This can be expressed as the AND operation:
#### $C = A \cdot B$

### **Logic Diagram:**

The logic diagram for a half adder can be constructed using:

- **XOR Gate** for the Sum (S) output
- **AND Gate** for the Carry (C) output

### **Conclusion:**
The answer to the question is **c)**.
