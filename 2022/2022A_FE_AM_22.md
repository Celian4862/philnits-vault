Which of the following uses a flip-flop circuit in a memory cell?


**a) DRAM**

**b) EEPROM**

**c) SDRAM**

**d) SRAM**
? 
**d) SRAM**

## **Explanation:**

The memory type that uses a flip-flop circuit in its memory cell is: **d) SRAM**

**a) DRAM (Dynamic Random Access Memory)**: DRAM uses capacitors to store bits of data, which must be refreshed periodically to maintain the stored information. It does not use flip-flops.

**b) EEPROM (Electrically Erasable Programmable Read-Only Memory)**: EEPROM uses a different technology for storing data, typically involving floating-gate transistors, but does not utilize flip-flops.

**c) SDRAM (Synchronous Dynamic Random Access Memory)**: SDRAM is a type of DRAM that is synchronized with the system clock but still relies on capacitors for data storage, not flip-flops.
