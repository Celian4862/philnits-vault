## **Explanation:**

#### **Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) procurement:**

- Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) procurement involves ensuring that the company’s purchasing decisions reflect ethical, social, and environmental considerations. It encourages businesses to adopt sustainable practices, which include taking into account the well-being of society and the environment. CSR procurement is closely tied to the concept of **sustainable procurement**, which emphasizes selecting suppliers who align with the company’s CSR goals. CSR is a self-regulation practice where businesses aim to contribute to societal goals while ensuring ethical behavior in their operations, including procurement.

- Sustainable Procurement involves sourcing products and services in a way that minimizes environmental impact and ensures ethical treatment of workers. Companies committed to CSR typically prefer suppliers who meet sustainability standards, such as reducing carbon emissions or supporting fair labor practices.

- The procurement department plays a crucial role in ensuring that external suppliers comply with CSR standards. This can include selecting suppliers based on their environmental policies, labor practices, or ethical sourcing methods.
  
	
	- **a) Choosing the product with the lowest price to minimize costs.**  
	    This option focuses solely on cost reduction and does not take CSR factors like environmental impact or ethical labor practices into account. Hence, it does not reflect the principles of CSR procurement.

	- **b) Having multiple suppliers to avoid situations in which procurement is impossible, such as after a disaster.**  
	    While having multiple suppliers is a strategic procurement decision, it is more related to **risk management** and does not directly address CSR procurement, which prioritizes ethical and sustainable sourcing.

	- **c) Indicating procurement standards that consider the environment, human rights, etc., and requesting that suppliers comply with these.**  
	    Correct! This option highlights the essence of CSR procurement, where companies enforce procurement standards that focus on ethical considerations like human rights and environmental sustainability.

	- **d) Using EDI to purchase goods in order to perform prompt and accurate procurement.**  
	    This option relates to **electronic data interchange (EDI)**, a tool used to automate procurement processes for efficiency, but it does not inherently address CSR-related concerns such as ethical sourcing or environmental impact.

The correct answer is **c) Indicating procurement standards that consider the environment, human rights, etc., and requesting that suppliers comply with these.** This reflects the principles of CSR procurement, which emphasizes ethical and sustainable practices over purely financial or operational concerns.
