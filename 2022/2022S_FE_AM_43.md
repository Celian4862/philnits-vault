When a mirror port is prepared to allow a LAN analyzer to be used for measurement in
order to investigate the cause of a network failure, which of the following is a point to
consider?
a) In preparation for a failure, it is necessary to inform network users of the storage location and usage method about the LAN analyzer.
b) Since LAN cables must be temporarily disconnected during measurement, it is necessary to give network users advance notice of the measurement date and time.
c) Since the LAN analyzer can display the packets that pass through the network, it is necessary to pay attention to misuse or abuse, such as wiretapping.
d) Since the LAN analyzer disposes of packets, it is necessary to restrict the use of the nontarget computers during measurement. 
? 
c) Since the LAN analyzer can display the packets that pass through the network, it is necessary to pay attention to misuse or abuse, such as wiretapping.

## **Explanation:**

A **LAN analyzer**, also known as a **packet analyzer**, is a tool used to monitor and capture network traffic for analysis. It helps network administrators troubleshoot issues like network failures, slowdowns, or security problems. To analyze network traffic, administrators typically use a mirror port (or SPAN port) to duplicate traffic to the analyzer without interrupting the flow of data in the network. However, since this tool captures all passing traffic, it can reveal sensitive information, making security precautions crucial. The key consideration when using a LAN analyzer is ensuring that the tool is not misused to access or exploit confidential data.

- A): Informing users of the storage location is not as important as securing the data being monitored.
- B): LAN analyzers typically do not require the disconnection of cables; they work passively.
- **C): Correctâ€”preventing misuse and ensuring data security is critical**.
- D): LAN analyzers do not dispose of packets; they capture and display them for analysis.
