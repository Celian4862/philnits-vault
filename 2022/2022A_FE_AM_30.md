In an IP network consisting of four (4) hosts, two (2) L2 switches, and a router shown below, a packet is transmitted from PC01 to PC03. Which of the following is an appropriate combination of the source and destination addresses of this packet when it leaves Switch1?

## **Explanation:**

To determine the appropriate combination of source and destination addresses when a packet is transmitted from **PC01** to **PC03**, we need to analyze the network configuration provided in the diagram.

Hereâ€™s the breakdown of the correct address combination when the packet leaves **Switch1**:

- **Source IP:** The source IP will remain `192.168.1.31` (PC01's IP address) because the IP addresses do not change as the packet moves between devices.
- **Destination IP:** The destination IP will remain `192.168.2.31` (PC03's IP address) because that's where the packet is ultimately heading.
- **Source MAC:** The source MAC address will be that of **PC01**, which is `aa:aa:aa:aa:aa`
- **Destination MAC:** Since the packet is heading toward the router to reach another subnet, the destination MAC address will be the MAC of the router's **Port 01** interface, which is `cc:cc:cc:cc:cc`.

Therefore, the answer is b) as it has the appropriate combination of the source and destination addresses of the packet when it leaves Switch1.
