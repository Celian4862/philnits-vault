In computerization investment planning, which of the following is an explanation of ROI as an evaluation index for investment value?
a) ROI is a measure that indicates market competitiveness in the event that a project is not implemented.
b) ROI is a measure that is calculated by dividing the profit generated through factors such as sales increase and cost reduction by the investment amount.
c) ROI is a measure that is calculated by subtracting the current value of cash outflow from the current value of cash inflow.
d) ROI is a measure that is obtained by comparing some parameters, such as the sales to investment ratio and the amount of investment per employee, with that of other companies.
? 
**b) ROI is a measure that is calculated by dividing the profit generated through factors such as sales increase and cost reduction by the investment amount.**
## **Explanation:**

#### **Return on Investment (ROI):**

**Return on Investment (ROI)** is one of the most commonly used metrics to assess how profitable an investment is compared to its cost. It helps decision-makers justify the allocation of funds by providing a quantifiable measurement of the potential returns on an investment.

ROI is a straightforward metric that compares the gains from an investment to the initial amount invested, expressed as a percentage. The higher the ROI, the more profitable the investment. It is widely used because it provides a simple way to evaluate the efficiency of investments and compare them against other opportunities.

#### **Key Concepts in ROI Calculation:**

1. **Investment Cost**: The total expenditure required for the project (including costs related to technology, labor, and other resources).
2. **Profit or Gain from Investment**: This includes any financial benefits resulting from the investment, such as increased sales or reduced operational costs.
3. **ROI Formula**:
   $$
    ROI = \left(\frac{\text{Net Profit}}{\text{Investment Cost}}\right) \times 100 
    $$
   
   This formula helps determine the percentage return on an investment relative to its cost. For example, if you invest $100 and generate a profit of $20, your ROI would be: 
   $$
   ROI = \left(\frac{20}{100}\right) \times 100 = 20\%
   $$

#### **Application in Investment Planning:**

In computerization or IT investment, ROI is often used to evaluate projects based on how much profit or savings (such as cost reductions through automation) the project will generate. It's important to assess the ROI before moving forward with an investment to ensure it adds value to the organization and aligns with strategic objectives.

- **a) ROI is a measure that indicates market competitiveness in the event that a project is not implemented.**  
  ROI focuses on the profitability of investments, not on market competitiveness or the consequences of not implementing a project.

- **b) ROI is a measure that is calculated by dividing the profit generated through factors such as sales increase and cost reduction by the investment amount.**  
  Correct. This option accurately reflects the definition and calculation of ROI. It involves calculating the returns (e.g., profits from increased sales or cost savings) relative to the initial investment.

- **c) ROI is a measure that is calculated by subtracting the current value of cash outflow from the current value of cash inflow.**  
  This is a definition closer to **Net Present Value (NPV)** rather than ROI. NPV accounts for the time value of money, which ROI does not.

- **d) ROI is a measure that is obtained by comparing some parameters, such as the sales to investment ratio and the amount of investment per employee, with that of other companies.**  ROI focuses on the internal returns of an investment relative to its cost, not on comparisons with other companies.

The correct explanation of ROI in the context of investment planning is **b) ROI is a measure that is calculated by dividing the profit generated through factors such as sales increase and cost reduction by the investment amount**. This formula helps assess the financial performance of a project by comparing its net profits to the initial investment.
