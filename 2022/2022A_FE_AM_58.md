When a business continuity plan (BCP) is developed given the possibility of a system failure, which of the following is the item that is implemented as part of business impact analysis? 

**a) Collectively educating the concerned persons about the alternate procedures and recovery procedures during an information system failure** 

**b) Determining the maximum allowable downtime for the information system** 

**c) Executing a test to verify the effectiveness of BCP** 

**d) Revising the contents of the BCP given changes in the internal and external environment of the information system**
? 
**b) Determining the maximum allowable downtime for the information system**

## **Explanation:**

**Business Impact Analysis (BIA)** is a crucial part of the business continuity planning process, focusing on identifying critical business functions and the impact that disruptions can have on those functions. One of the key aspects of BIA is determining the **Maximum Allowable Downtime (MAD)**, which defines how long a system can be down before significantly impacting the organization.

### Brief Overview of Other Options:

- **a)** While educating concerned persons about procedures is important, it is more about training and awareness rather than BIA itself.
- **c)** Executing tests to verify BCP effectiveness is part of the testing and maintenance phase of BCP, not BIA.
- **d)** Revising the BCP based on changes is part of the ongoing maintenance and review process but not specifically a part of BIA.

In summary, the correct answer is **b) Determining the maximum allowable downtime for the information system.**
