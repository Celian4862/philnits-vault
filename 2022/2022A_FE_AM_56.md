Which of the following is an appropriate description of the relationship between a record of an incident and a record of a problem in IT service management? 

**a) A cross-reference to the incident that triggered the record of the problem is included in the record of the problem.** 

**b) If known errors have been identified at the time of ending the record of the problem, the record of the incident that triggered the record of the problem is deleted.** 

**c) One (1) problem record is always associated with one (1) incident record.** 

**d) Problems are classified and recorded by a different criterion from the classification of incidents.**
? 
**a) A cross-reference to the incident that triggered the record of the problem is included in the record of the problem.**

## **Explanation:**

In IT service management, an **incident** is an unplanned interruption or reduction in the quality of an IT service, while a **problem** is the underlying cause of one or more incidents. When a problem record is created, it typically includes a cross-reference to the incident(s) that triggered it, helping to track the relationship between the incidents and the problem being investigated.

### Brief Overview of Other Options:

- **b)** The record of the incident is not deleted when a problem record is created; instead, the incident remains in the records for reference and tracking purposes.
- **c)** A problem record can be associated with multiple incident records, especially if the same issue affects multiple users or services.
- **d)** While problems and incidents may be classified differently, they are often related, and their classification criteria are not necessarily distinct.

In summary, the correct answer is **a) A cross-reference to the incident that triggered the record of the problem is included in the record of the problem.**
