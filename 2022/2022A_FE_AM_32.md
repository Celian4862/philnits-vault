Which of the following is the subnet mask corresponding to an IP address in slash notation, 192.168.22.31/27?

**a) 255.255.255.192** 

**b) 255.255.255.224** 

**c) 255.255.255.248**

**d) 255.255.255.252**
? 
**b) 255.255.255.224** 

## **Explanation:**

The notation `/27` indicates that the first 27 bits of the IP address are used for the network portion, and the remaining 5 bits are for the host portion.

A subnet mask represents the network portion with `1`s and the host portion with `0`s. For a `/27` subnet, the subnet mask would be:
`11111111.11111111.11111111.11100000`

Converting the binary value `11100000` to decimal gives `224`, so the full subnet mask is:
`255.255.255.224`

Thus, the subnet mask corresponding to `192.168.22.31/27` is `255.255.255.224`. Therefore, the answer is **b)**.
