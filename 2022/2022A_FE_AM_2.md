Which of the following is an appropriate explanation of the loss of significance?

**a) It occurs when the result of an operation exceeds the maximum handle limit and raises an exception.** 

**b) It occurs when two nearly equal floating-point numbers are subtracted to produce a result of unacceptably reduced significant digits.** 

**c) It refers to a rounding error that occurs when the part smaller than the least significant digit of the result is rounded off, up, or down in floating-point operations.** 

**d) It refers to the case when two floating-point numbers are added, but the less significant digits of either one do not affect the result.**
? 
**b) It occurs when two nearly equal floating-point numbers are subtracted to produce a result of unacceptably reduced significant digits.** 
## **Explanation:**

**Loss of significance** (also called **catastrophic cancellation**) happens in numerical computing when **subtracting two nearly equal numbers in floating-point arithmetic**. This subtraction causes the **significant digits in the result to be lost**, leaving a result with very few meaningful digits.

a) Describes **overflow**. **Overflow** occurs when the result of a computation is too large to be represented in the available number of bits. This raises an exception or error in most systems.

c) Describes **rounding error**, which happens when the exact result of a floating-point operation cannot be represented in a finite number of digits, so the result is rounded. While related to precision, this is not specifically **loss of significance**.

d) Describes **absorption** or **precision loss due to addition**, where adding a very small number to a much larger number results in the small number having no effect due to the limitations of floating-point precision. This is a different phenomenon than **loss of significance** caused by subtraction.
