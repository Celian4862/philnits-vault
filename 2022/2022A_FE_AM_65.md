**a) Concluding a contract** 

**b) RFI** 

**c) RFP** 

**d) Selecting a provider**
? 
**c) RFP** 

## **Explanation:**

- **RFP** is the document created by the orderer that outlines the requirements for the system and requests proposals from vendors. It comes after the **RFI** (Request for Information) and before the selection of a provider, making it the correct fit for the sequence described.

### Brief Overview of Other Options:

- **a)** Concluding a contract: This occurs after the procurement source has been selected, so it doesn't fit in the blank.
- **b)** RFI: This is typically used before the RFP stage to gather information from vendors but doesn't fit as a request for proposal.
- **d)** Selecting a provider: This is a later step in the procurement process and doesn't belong in the context of the immediate preceding step.

In summary, the correct answer for blank **B** is **c)** **RFP**.
