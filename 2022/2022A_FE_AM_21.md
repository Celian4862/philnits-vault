By using a sensor that detects changes in shape, the condition of infrastructure such as elevated highways can be monitored and maintained. Which of the following is a sensor that is used for this purpose?


**a) Gyro**

**b) Hall Element**

**c) Strain Gage**

**d) Thermistor**
? 
**c) Strain Gage**

## **Explanation:**

A **strain gage** measures the amount of deformation (strain) in an object when a force is applied. This makes it highly effective for monitoring the structural integrity of infrastructure, as it can detect changes in shape due to stress or strain. Therefore, the answer is **c)**.

**a) Gyro**: A gyroscope measures angular velocity and orientation, which is useful for navigation and stability control but not for detecting changes in shape.
    
**b) Hall element**: Hall effect sensors detect magnetic fields and are commonly used for position sensing and current measurement but are not designed for monitoring structural changes.
    
**d) Thermistor**: A thermistor is a temperature-sensitive resistor used to measure temperature changes. While it can monitor thermal conditions, it does not detect changes in shape or deformation.
