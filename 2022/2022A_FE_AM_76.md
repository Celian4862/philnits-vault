Which of the following is a process of discovering useful patterns and relationships by the analysis of large volumes of data? 

**a) Brainstorming** 

**b) Data mining** 

**c) Decision tree** 

**d) Document analysis**
? 
**b) Data mining**

## **Explanation:**

**Data mining** is the process of discovering patterns, trends, and relationships in large volumes of data through various analytical methods. It involves using statistical techniques, machine learning, and database systems to extract valuable information that can help in decision-making, predictions, and understanding complex data sets.

### Overview of Other Options:

- **a)** **Brainstorming**: A creative technique used to generate a large number of ideas or solutions in a group setting, not specifically related to data analysis.
- **c)** **Decision tree**: A predictive modeling tool that uses a tree-like graph of decisions and their possible consequences but is a technique rather than a broader process for analyzing large data sets.
- **d)** **Document analysis**: Involves examining documents to extract relevant information but does not encompass the broader concept of analyzing large volumes of data for patterns.

Therefore, the answer is **b)**.
