**d) It is a mechanism mainly between individuals to share, lend, or borrow idle assets owned by individuals by utilizing the community functions of social media.**

## **Explanation:**

The **sharing economy** refers to a system where individuals share or exchange their idle assets—such as accommodation, transportation, tools, and services—often facilitated by digital platforms and social media. This concept emphasizes **collaboration**, allowing people to lend, borrow, or share resources efficiently, thereby reducing waste and promoting sustainability. Therefore, the answer is **d)**.

### Overview of Other Options:

- **a)** Describes the use of IT for managing renewable energy and urban infrastructure, focusing on quality of life and economic growth but not specifically addressing the sharing of assets.
- **b)** Discusses overall economic productivity and supply chain management (SCM) improvements through IT but does not relate to sharing between individuals.
- **c)** Refers to combining different sales methods (over-the-counter and online) to boost sales, which is unrelated to sharing assets or the concept of the sharing economy.
