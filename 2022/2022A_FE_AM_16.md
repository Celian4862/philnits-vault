Which of the following is the approximate availability of the entire system in the figure below? The availability is calculated by rounding off to two decimal places. The numeric value within parentheses is the availability of each device, and the system is available when two or more of the devices connected in parallel are operating in the left part (device 1 to 3) and one or more of the devices connected in parallel is operating in the right part (device 4 to 5).

**a) 0.65**

**b) 0.81**

**c) 0.94**

**d) 0.99**
? 
**c) 0.94**
## **Explanation:**

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the overall system availability based on the given devices and their availability. The system is made up of two parts:

- **Left part (Devices 1, 2, and 3)**: The system is available if **two or more** devices are working.
- **Right part (Devices 4 and 5)**: The system is available if **one or more** devices are working.

### **Step-by-step process:**

#### **1. Calculate the availability for the left part (Devices 1, 2, and 3):**

We first calculate the probability that all three devices fail:

$P(\text{all fail}) = (1 - 0.9) \times (1 - 0.8) \times (1 - 0.9) = 0.1 \times 0.2 \times 0.1 = 0.002$

Next, we calculate the probability that exactly one device is working (causing the system to fail):

$P(\text{only Device 1}) = 0.9 \times (1 - 0.8) \times (1 - 0.9) = 0.9 \times 0.2 \times 0.1 = 0.018$ 
$P(\text{only Device 2}) = (1 - 0.9) \times 0.8 \times (1 - 0.9) = 0.1 \times 0.8 \times 0.1 = 0.008$
$P(\text{only Device 3}) = (1 - 0.9) \times (1 - 0.8) \times 0.9 = 0.1 \times 0.2 \times 0.9 = 0.018$

Thus, the total probability of failure of two or more devices is:

$P(\text{left part unavailable}) = 0.002 + 0.018 + 0.008 + 0.018 = 0.046$

Therefore, the availability of the left part is:

$P(\text{left part available}) = 1 - 0.046 = 0.954$

#### **2. Calculate the availability for the right part (Devices 4 and 5):**

For the right part, the system is available if at least one device is working. The probability that both fail is:

$P(\text{both fail}) = (1 - 0.9) \times (1 - 0.9) = 0.1 \times 0.1 = 0.01$

Thus, the availability of the right part is:

$P(\text{right part available}) = 1 - 0.01 = 0.99$

#### **3. Calculate the overall system availability:**

The overall system availability is the product of the availabilities of the left and right parts:

$\text{System availability} = P(\text{left part available}) \times P(\text{right part available})$
$= 0.954 \times 0.99 = 0.94446$

### **Conclusion:**
The system availability is $0.94446$. Since **c** has the closest answer, it is the correct choice.
