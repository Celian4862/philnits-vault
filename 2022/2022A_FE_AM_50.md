In eXtreme Programming (XP), which of the following is advocated as a practice? 

**a) Inspection** 

**b) Pair programming** 

**c) Structured design** 

**d) Use case utilization**
? 
**b) Pair programming** 

## **Explanation:**

**Pair programming** is a core practice in eXtreme Programming (XP) where two programmers work together at one workstation. One programmer, called the "driver," writes the code while the other, called the "observer" or "navigator," reviews each line of code as it is written. This practice enhances collaboration, allows for real-time feedback, and helps to improve code quality while also fostering knowledge sharing between team members.

### Brief Overview of Other Options:

- **a) Inspection:** While inspection is a quality assurance practice, it is not specific to eXtreme Programming.
- **c) Structured design:** This refers to a traditional software design approach, not a specific practice within XP.
- **d) Use case utilization:** While use cases can be utilized in XP, they are not a primary practice of the methodology.

In summary, the correct answer is **b) Pair programming.**
