Which of the following is a software development model that repeats the development processes from requirements analysis to implementation?
a) Prototyping model
b) Relational model
c) Spiral model
d) Waterfall model
? 
c) Spiral model
## **Explanation:**

A software development model that involves an iterative approach, where the phases (such as requirements analysis, design, and implementation) are repeated through multiple cycles.

- A) Prototyping model: The prototyping model focuses on building a working prototype of the system to refine requirements through feedback, but it doesn't explicitly repeat all phases from requirements to implementation in a cyclic manner like the Spiral model.
- B) Relational model: The relational model is not a software development model but a data model used for databases. It defines how data is structured in terms of rows and tables (relations).
- **C) Spiral model: Spiral model is an iterative software development model that combines elements of both design and prototyping. It allows for repeated cycles, where each phase (such as planning, risk analysis, engineering, and evaluation) is revisited, refining the product progressively through multiple iterations.**
- D) Waterfall model: The Waterfall model is a linear and sequential approach where each phase (requirements, design, implementation, etc.) happens once, without going back to previous phases. It does not repeat the development processes like the Spiral model.
