## **Explanation:**

#### **Customer Relationship Management (CRM):**

**Customer Relationship Management (CRM)** refers to the practices, technologies, and strategies that businesses use to manage and improve their interactions with customers. The primary goal of CRM is to enhance customer experience, improve customer satisfaction, and build long-term customer loyalty. CRM systems help businesses organize customer information, streamline sales and marketing processes, and analyze customer behavior to increase profitability.

CRM is important for understanding customer preferences and trends which helps businesses make informed decisions. It also aims to improve customer retention by personalizing interactions and offering better service. CRM systems can handle various tasks, from sales tracking to customer support, ensuring that customer needs are met efficiently and effectively.

### **Answer Choices:**

- **a) Acquisition of customer loyalty and maximization of customer lifetime value.**  
  
    This is the correct answer. The primary purpose of CRM is to build customer loyalty by improving interactions and relationships with customers, thereby increasing customer lifetime value (CLV). CRM systems focus on long-term customer satisfaction and retention, which are key to maximizing CLV.

- **b) Ascertainment of the sales information for each product at the time of sales.**  
  
    This option refers more to sales reporting or inventory management rather than the overall purpose of CRM. While CRM can track sales data, its main objective is building customer relationships, not just sales tracking.

- **c) Determination of the order quantity and order timing of material required for manufacturing.**  
  
    This relates to **supply chain management (SCM)** or **material requirements planning (MRP)**, not CRM. SCM and MRP focus on optimizing the flow of goods and materials in production, whereas CRM is customer-focused.

- **d) Reduction in loss of sales opportunities due to inventory shortage.**  
  
    This would be more aligned with inventory or stock management systems, not CRM. CRM focuses on managing customer interactions and improving relationships, rather than managing inventory or stock levels.

The correct answer is **a) Acquisition of customer loyalty and maximization of customer lifetime value**. CRM is designed to enhance customer satisfaction, improve retention, and ultimately increase the profitability of a business by ensuring customers remain loyal over time.
