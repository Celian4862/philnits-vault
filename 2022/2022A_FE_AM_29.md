In a company, the received-orders are monitored monthly based on the customer file, product file, person-in-charge file, and the current monthâ€™s received-orders file. When the items of each file are as shown in the table below, which of the following can be retrieved for the received orders of current month and the three (3) previous months using the four (4) files?

**a) Customer-wise received orders by product** 

**b) Customer-wise received orders by the person in charge** 

**c) Person-in-charge-wise received orders by product** 

**d) Product-wise received orders by customer**
? 
**b) Customer-wise received orders by the person in charge**

## **Explanation:**

- The **Customer file** links each customer to a specific person-in-charge through the person-in-charge code.
- The **Current month's received orders file** provides information on received orders, mapped to the customer through the customer code.
- By joining these two files, you can retrieve the received orders for the **current month** and the previous three months, **organized by customer and the person-in-charge**.

So, with the data structure presented, you can retrieve the orders for each customer, categorized by the person responsible for them.
