Which of the following is an appropriate tool that implements a deliverable-oriented decomposition of a project into smaller components?
a) Critical path method (CPM)
b) Gantt chart (Gantt)
c) Program evaluation and review technique (PERT)
d) Work breakdown structure (WBS)
? 
d) Work breakdown structure (WBS)
## **Explanation:**

In project management, itâ€™s important to break down a project into manageable pieces for effective planning and execution. This process allows teams to focus on specific tasks, estimate costs and durations, and allocate resources efficiently.

Identify the tool that specifically focuses on this deliverable-oriented approach, which helps in organizing a project into smaller, more manageable components.

- A) Critical path method (CPM): CPM is a project management technique used to determine the longest sequence of dependent tasks and the minimum project duration. While it is useful for scheduling, it does not focus on breaking the project into smaller components like the WBS does.
- B) Gantt chart (Gantt): A Gantt chart is a visual representation of a project schedule, showing tasks along a timeline. While it helps track progress, it does not inherently involve the decomposition of project deliverables, which is the primary function of the WBS.
- C) Program evaluation and review technique (PERT): PERT is a statistical tool used to analyze and represent the tasks involved in completing a project, emphasizing the time needed to complete each task and identifying the minimum time required to complete the total project. However, like CPM, it does not focus on breaking down deliverables into smaller components.
- **D) Work breakdown structure (WBS): The Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) is a hierarchical decomposition of a project into smaller, more manageable sections, known as work packages. This tool provides a clear framework for organizing tasks, helping teams visualize the project scope and ensuring that all deliverables are accounted for. The WBS is essential for project planning, resource allocation, and tracking progress.**
