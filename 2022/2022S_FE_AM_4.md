### What is Reverse Polish Notation?
- a method of expressing mathematical formulas we use every day in a form more easily processed by computers. The basic concept of this notation is that the operators are written toward the end as opposed to the middle of a formula.

### So basically, we iterate through the numbers and when encounter an operation, we pop the last 2 numbers and apply the operation.

#### Step 1: Evaluate the given expression (3 4 - 5 x)
- Push *3*
- Push *4*
- We can see and operator (*-*), so we pop the last 2 numbers and apply the operation. The first number should be the 2nd one popped.
- Pop *4*
- Pop *3*
- *3 - 4* = *-1*
- So the stack expression would now be **-1 5 x**
- Push *-1*
- Push *5*
- We encounter an operator **x**, so we pop 2 numbers and apply the operation.
- Pop *5*
- Pop *-1*
- *-1 x 5* = *-5*

**So the expression evaluates to -5, let's check why C) is the answer.

#### Step 2: Evaluating C (5 3 4 - x)
- Push *5*
- Push *3*
- Push *4*
- We encounter an operation *-*, so we pop the last 2 numbers
- Pop *4*
- Pop *3*
- *3 - 4* = *-1*
- We encounter another operation *x*
- Pop *-1*
- Pop *5*
- *-1 x 5* = *-5*

**The expression also evaluates to -5, which matches the given expression's output**
