Among the software development activities, which of the following corresponds to refactoring that is emphasized in agile development? 

**a) To improve the maintainability of a program, the internal structure of a program is changed without any change in the external specifications.** 

**b) To improve the quality of a program, two (2) programmers cooperate and perform the coding of one (1) program.** 

**c) To obtain feedback from the users, a prototype of the software is created at an early stage.** 

**d) To promptly develop a program, test cases are set in advance, and then the program is coded.**
? 
**a) To improve the maintainability of a program, the internal structure of a program is changed without any change in the external specifications.** 

## **Explanation:**

**Refactoring** refers to the process of restructuring existing computer code without changing its external behavior. The goal is to improve the internal structure, readability, and maintainability of the code. In agile development, refactoring is often performed to make the codebase cleaner and easier to work with, enhancing the overall quality of the software without altering what the software does from the user's perspective.

### Brief Overview of Other Options:

- **b)** This describes pair programming, which is a collaborative coding practice rather than refactoring.
- **c)** This refers to prototyping, a technique for gathering user feedback early in the development process, not specifically related to refactoring.
- **d)** This describes test-driven development (TDD), where tests are written before the code, which is a separate practice from refactoring.

In summary, the correct answer is **a) To improve the maintainability of a program, the internal structure of a program is changed without any change in the external specifications.**
