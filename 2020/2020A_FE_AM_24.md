Which of the following is a method of improving the appearance of a jagged edge of a slanted line to be smoothed on a screen, such as that of an LCD?
a) Anti-aliasing
b) Bump mapping
c) Shading
d) Texture mapping
? 
a) Anti-aliasing
### Explanation:

b) **Incorrect**
- **Bump mapping** is a technique used to create the illusion of surface detail and texture without adding more geometry.
c) **Incorrect**
- **Shading** refers to the process of adjusting the color and brightness of surfaces in 3D models to simulate light and shadow, giving a sense of depth and realism.
d) **Incorrect**
- **Texture mapping** is the process of applying a 2D image (a texture) onto the surface of a 3D model to add detail like color or patterns.
a) **Correct**
- **Anti-aliasing** is a technique used to reduce the appearance of jagged edges (also known as "aliasing") on diagonal or curved lines on a digital screen.
