Which of the following represents appropriate handling for open source software according to OSI’s definition?
a) For open- source software that is created for a specific industry, the scope of publishing of the source code can be limited to that industry.
b) If open- source software is to be modified for uses such as internal use by a company without being redistributed, the modified part of the source code does not have to be published.
c) When open- source software is modified and redistributed, the same license as the original software must be used for distribution so that the distribution conditions are remain the same as the original software.
d) When open- source software is redistributed by a third party as a product, the developer of the open- source software can charge a license fee to the third party.

b) If open- source software is to be modified for uses such as internal use by a company without being redistributed, the modified part of the source code does not have to be published.
### Definition:

The Open Source Initiative (OSI) defines open-source software as software that meets certain criteria:
- **Free redistribution:** The software must be freely redistributable, including the right to sell copies.
- **Source code availability:** The source code must be made available, allowing users to modify and improve the software.
- **Derivative works:** Users must be allowed to create derivative works of the software and distribute them.
- **No discrimination against persons or groups:** The software cannot discriminate against any person or group.
- **No discrimination against fields of endeavor:** The software cannot be restricted to any particular field of endeavor.
- **Distribution of license terms:** The license terms must be attached to the software and must allow for redistribution.

### Comparison:
a) **Incorrect**
- It limits the scope of publishing the source code to a specific industry, which violates the principle of "free redistribution" and "no discrimination against fields of endeavor."
b) **Incorrect**
- It suggests that modified parts of the software do not need to be published if they are not being redistributed, which violates the principle of "source code availability" and "derivative works".
d) **Incorrect**
- It suggests that the original developer can charge a license fee for redistribution by a third party, which violates the principle of "free redistribution".
c) **Correct**
- It directly addresses the requirement for "free redistribution" and ensures that the same conditions for distribution are maintained when the software is modified and redistributed.
