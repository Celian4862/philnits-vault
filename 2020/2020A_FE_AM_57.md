Which of the following is the most appropriate description about the backup of data on a disk that is connected to a server? 

a) All data are backed up on the day the system commences full operations, and only frequently updated data are backed up thereafter to shorten the work time. 
b) Data distributed and stored in multiple files are backed up when a series of update processes to the files are completed. 
c) Data whose frequency of use are low after a certain period of time are deleted from the current disk, and the data that have been backed up are also deleted. 
d) Important data are backed up by overwriting data on the same media, so that the backup media are not mistaken.
?
b) Data distributed and stored in multiple files are backed up when a series of update processes to the files are completed. 
## **Explanation:**

b) suggests that the backup process is conducted after a series of updates, ensuring that the latest version of the files is captured. This strategy helps maintain consistency and ensures that the backup reflects the most current state of the data.

### Other Operations

 **a)** This option implies a fixed schedule for backups that may not account for all changes made in between, risking data being out of date.

**c)** While managing data based on usage frequency is a common practice, automatically deleting backed-up data can lead to potential data loss, which is not typically advisable.

**d)** Overwriting important data on the same media is not a recommended practice, as it increases the risk of data loss.
