What is the broadcast address of a network to which the IP address 192.168.57.123/22 belongs?

a) 192.168.55.255
b) 192.168.57.255
c) 192.168.59.255
d) 192.168.63.255
? 
c) 192.168.59.255
## **Explanation:**

### Step 1: Understand the Subnet Mask

The CIDR notation `/22` indicates that the subnet mask has 22 bits
- **Subnet Mask**: 255.255.252.0
- In binary: `11111111.11111111.11111100.00000000`

### Step 2: Determine the *Network* Address

To find the network address, perform a bitwise AND operation between the IP address and the subnet mask.
- **IP Address**: 192.168.57.123 (binary:`11000000.10101000.00111001.01111011`)
- **Subnet Mask**: 255.255.252.0 (binary: `11111111.11111111.11111100.00000000`)

Bitwise AND of IP address and Subnet Mask
```
(192.168.56.0)  11000000.10101000.00111000.00000000
(255.255.252.0) 11111111.11111111.11111100.00000000
---------------------------------------------------
(192.168.56.0)  11000000.10101000.00111000.00000000
```
The network address is **192.168.56.0**.
### Step 3: Calculate the Broadcast Address

With a `/22` mask, there are **10 bits** for hosts (32 total bits - 22 bits for the network). This means the broadcast address is calculated by adding `2^10 - 1` to the network address:
- **Host Range**: 192.168.56.0 to 192.168.59.255
- The broadcast address is the last address in this range: **192.168.59.255**.
