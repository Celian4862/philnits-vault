## **Explanation:**

**Total Cost of Ownership (TCO)** refers to the **total lifetime cost** of a system or asset, including all expenses from its installation, development, ongoing operation, maintenance, and eventual disposal or retirement. TCO provides a comprehensive view of the costs involved in owning and managing a system beyond just the initial purchase or installation.
### Other Options

**a) It is the total amount of expenses at the time of system installation** – This only considers the cost at the time of installation, but TCO includes all costs over the system's entire life.

**b) It is the total amount of expenses related to the development of business systems** – TCO goes beyond just development costs to include operational and maintenance costs as well.

**d) It is the total amount of operation expenses for systems related to communications and networking** – This is only a subset of TCO, which includes all aspects, not just communication and networking expenses.
