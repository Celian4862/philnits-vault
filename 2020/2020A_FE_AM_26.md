### Understanding the SQL Query Logic:

Let's break down the logic needed for the SQL Query in this problem:
1. **Goal of the Query**:
    - We want to retrieve the **Manager_ID** and the **average salary** of the employees reporting directly to each manager. The query must be structured to join the employee table with itself to compare employees and their managers.
2. **Self-Join (Employees a, Employees b)**:
    - We are joining the `Employees` table with itself (aliasing as `a` and `b`).
    - In this case:
        - `a` represents the **employees** (whose salaries we are averaging).
        - `b` represents the **managers** of those employees.
3. **Columns E and F**:
    - We need to retrieve the **Manager_ID** for each manager and the average salary of their employees.
4. **Correct Mapping of E and F**:
    - **E** is the **Manager_ID** (from table `b`, because `b` represents the managers).
    - **F** is the **Emp_ID** (from table `a`, because `a` represents the employees who report to the managers).
    - This is based on the `WHERE` condition, which checks if `a.Manager_ID = b.Emp_ID`. This condition matches each employee (`a`) with their manager (`b`).
5. **Grouping and Ordering**:
    - We group by the **Manager_ID** (`b.Emp_ID`), as we want to calculate the average salary of the employees for each manager.
    - We also order the results by **Manager_ID** (`b.Emp_ID`) to display the managers in order.

### Why option d is correct?:

- **E** should be `b.Emp_ID`, which represents the **Manager_ID** in the final output (because `b` is the manager).
- **F** should be `a.Manager_ID`, which represents the manager's ID in relation to the employee (because `a` is the employee).
