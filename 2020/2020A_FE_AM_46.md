Which of the following is an appropriate relation between a class and an instance in object-oriented programming?

a) An instance defines the specifications of a class. 
b) An instance is created based on the definition for a class. 
c) Multiple classes correspond to one (1) instance. 
d) Only one (1) instance exists for one (1) class.
? 
b) An instance is created based on the definition for a class. 
## **Explanation:**

%% ignore this %%
---
In object-oriented programming (OOP), a **class** acts as a blueprint for creating **instances** (or objects). When you instantiate a class, you're creating an object that has the properties and behaviors defined in the class. For example, if you have a class named Dog, an instance could be a specific dog like `myDog`, which has its own attributes that is defined in the Dog class.
### Other Options

**a) An instance defines the specifications of a class**: This is incorrect because the class defines the specifications, not the instance. An instance is a realization of that specification.

**c) Multiple classes correspond to one (1) instance**: This is incorrect since one instance is created from a single class. A class can have multiple instances, but each instance belongs to only one class.

**d) Only one (1) instance exists for one (1) class**: This is also incorrect. A class can have many instances. For example, the `Dog` class can have instances like `dog1`, `dog2`, etc.
