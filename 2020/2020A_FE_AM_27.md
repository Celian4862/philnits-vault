### Understanding the Relationships and Conditions:

Let's break them down:
1. **Condition (1): One or more employees belong to a department.**
    - This implies that a department must have at least one employee, but it can have many employees.
    - This is reflected by a **1..*** multiplicity on the department side (because each department must have at least one employee, but can have many).
    - Therefore, the multiplicity in **I** (on the side of "Department") should be **1..***.
2. **Condition (2): An employee belongs to only one department.**
    - This implies that an employee cannot belong to more than one department at the same time (i.e., one-to-one relationship at any given moment).
    - This is represented by a multiplicity of **1..1** on the employee side in the "Assignment history" entity. In the context of the "Assignment history," each entry will correspond to exactly one employee and exactly one department at a given time.
3. **Condition (3): The history of departments to which an employee has belonged is recorded as the assignment history.**
    - This means an employee can have many entries in the assignment history, reflecting multiple departments they have belonged to over time.
    - Thus, the "Assignment history" can have multiple entries per employee, making the multiplicity on the employee side **1..*** (because an employee can have multiple assignment records, but each record belongs to one employee at a time).
    - Therefore, the multiplicity in **II** (on the side of "Employee") should be **1..***.

### Why option d is correct?:

- **I** (Department side of the assignment history): A department can have one or more employees. Hence, the multiplicity is **1..***.
- **II** (Employee side of the assignment history): An employee can have multiple assignments in the history (but each assignment relates to exactly one employee). Hence, the multiplicity is **1..***.
