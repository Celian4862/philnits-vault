?
b) Integration of the code and testing are continuously repeated. 
## **Explanation:**

Extreme Programming (XP) emphasizes continuous integration and testing throughout the development process. This ensures that the software is always in a working state, and issues are identified early. It is very collaborative and encourages continuous communication between the customer and the development team.

> [!TIP] 
> The idea is that everyone works together closely—developers, customers, and testers—so that the software is always moving in the right direction and evolving based on constant feedback.
