Which of the following is used in quality management to help determine whether a process is stable by using plotted time-series data and limit lines? 

a) Brainstorming 
b) Cause-and-effect diagram 
c) Control chart 
d) Run chart
?
c) Control chart 
## **Explanation:**

A **control chart** is used in quality management to monitor and determine whether a process is stable over time. It displays time-series data and includes upper and lower control limits to track variation. If the data points remain within these limits, the process is considered stable. Control charts help identify any trends or deviations from the norm.

### Other Options

**a) Brainstorming** – This is a technique used for generating ideas or solutions, not for monitoring process stability.

**b) Cause-and-effect diagram** – Also known as a fishbone diagram, it is used to identify potential causes of problems but does not track process stability over time.

**d) Run chart** – A run chart also plots data over time, but it doesn't have control limits like a control chart, making it less useful for determining process stability.
