Approximately how many seconds is required to transmit a file of $106$ bytes via a $64$-kbit/s communication line? Here, the transmission efficiency of the line is $80$%.
a) 19.6
b) 100
c) 124
d) 156
? 
d) 156
### Step 1: Convert the file size to bits.

Formula: bytes $\times$ bits/byte
$= 1,000,000 \times 8 = 8,000,000$ bits

### Step 2: Calculate the effective transmission speed.

Formula: Effective speed = kbit/s $\times$ transmission efficiency
$= 64 \times 0.80 = 51.2$ kbit/s

### Step 3: Convert the kbit/s to bits.

$= 51.2 = 51,200$ bits

### Step 4: Calculate the time to transmit the file.

$\frac{8,000,000}{51,2000} = 156.2$ seconds

- Therefore, option d, 156, is correct.
