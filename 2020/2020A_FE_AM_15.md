Which of the following achieves data redundancy via mirroring?
a) RAID 0
b) RAID 1
c) RAID 5
d) RAID 6
? 
b) RAID 1
### Explanation:

- **a) RAID 0**: This does **not** provide redundancy. Instead, it uses **striping**, where data is split across multiple disks. It improves performance but offers no fault tolerance—if one disk fails, all data is lost.
    
- **c) RAID 5**: This uses **striping with parity**, which provides fault tolerance by distributing parity information across the drives. RAID 5 can tolerate one drive failure but does not use mirroring.
    
- **d) RAID 6**: Similar to RAID 5, RAID 6 uses **striping with double parity**, allowing it to tolerate two simultaneous drive failures. However, it does not use mirroring.

a) **Incorrect**
- RAID 0 uses **striping**, where data is split across multiple disks. It improves performance but offers no fault tolerance—if one disk fails, all data is lost.
c) **Incorrect**
- RAID 5 uses **striping with parity**, which provides fault tolerance by distributing parity information across the drives. RAID 5 can tolerate one drive failure.
d) **Incorrect**
- RAID 6 uses **striping with double parity**, allowing it to tolerate two simultaneous drive failures.
b) **Correct**
- RAID 1 uses **mirroring**, where all data is written to two (or more) drives simultaneously. This creates an exact copy (mirror) of the data on multiple drives, ensuring redundancy. If one drive fails, the data can still be retrieved from the other mirrored drive(s).
