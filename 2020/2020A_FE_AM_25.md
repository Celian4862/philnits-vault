c) $A, P$
### Step 1: Understanding Function Dependency

Functional Dependencies basically work like this:
- $A$ → $B$: Knowing $A$ allows us to determine $B$
- $A$ → $C$: Knowing $A$ allows us to determine $C$
- $CP$ → $Q$: Knowing both $C$ and $P$ allows us to determine $Q$
- $CP$ → $T$: Knowing both $C$ and $P$ allows us to determine $T$

### Step 2: Apply and Compare

a) **Incorrect**
- Knowing $A$ only allows us to derive both $B$ and $C$.
b) **Incorrect**
- Knowing $A$ only allows us to derive both $B$ and $C$. We cannot derive anything with $B$.
d) **Incorrect**
- Knowing $C$ and $P$ only allows us to derive both $Q$ and $T$.
c) **Correct**
- Knowing $A$ allows us to derive both $B$ and $C$. Now, knowing  $C$ and $P$ allows us to derive both $Q$ and $T$.

- Thus, $A$ and $P$ can determine all attributes in the relation.
