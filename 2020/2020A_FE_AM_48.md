In the development process, which of the following is an activity that should be performed for software architectural design? 

a) Analyzing the requirements in incremental steps by expressing them in the form of a diagram, etc. 
b) Describing the specifications so that the program is clarified on a line-by-line basis 
c) Obtaining the opinion of the customer and determining the specifications 
d) Transforming the requirements for the software item into an architecture that describes its top-level structure and identifies its software components
? 
d) Transforming the requirements for the software item into an architecture that describes its top-level structure and identifies its software components
## **Explanation:**

In software architectural design, the main goal is to take the requirements and develop a high-level structure that outlines the key components and how they interact. This ensures the system meets the functional and non-functional requirements.
### Other Options

**a) Analyzing the requirements in incremental steps by expressing them in the form of a diagram, etc.** – This refers more to _requirements analysis_, not architectural design.

**b) Describing the specifications so that the program is clarified on a line-by-line basis** – This is more aligned with _detailed design_ or coding, not the architectural level.

**c) Obtaining the opinion of the customer and determining the specifications** – This is part of the _requirements gathering_ phase, which occurs before architectural design.
