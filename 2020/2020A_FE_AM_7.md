b) It repeats the process of finding the minimum element of the data, followed by its removal.
c) It repeats the process of inserting each element of data into the correct position of a sorted sequence.
d) It repeats the process of selecting an element as a pivot and partitions the data so that smaller elements appear before the pivot, and larger elements appear afterwards.
