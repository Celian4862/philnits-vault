Which of the following is an appropriate description of DRAM?
a) It is memory that requires a refresh operation, and it is used as the main memory of a PC.
b) It is non-volatile memory of a NAND type or a NOR type, and it is used as an SSD.
c) It is non-volatile memory that is capable of erasing and writing data in byte units, and it is used when data need to be retained even when the power supply is turned off.
d) Its memory cells consist of flip-flops, and it is used for cache memory.
? 
a) It is memory that requires a refresh operation, and it is used as the main memory of a PC.
### Explanation:

b) **Incorrect**
- It describes flash memory, which is a type of non-volatile memory used in solid-state drives (SSDs).
c) **Incorrect**
- It describes NOR flash memory, which is another type of non-volatile memory used in embedded systems and microcontrollers.
d) **Incorrect**
- It describes SRAM (Static Random Access Memory), which is another type of volatile memory used for cache memory.
a) **Correct**
- DRAM is a type of volatile memory that requires periodic refreshing to retain its data. It is the most common type of main memory used in computers due to its high capacity and relatively low cost.
