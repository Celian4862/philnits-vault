Which of the following is an appropriate description of the dispatcher in an operating system?
a) A function in which multiple tasks appear to be running simultaneously on a single processor
b) The allocation of the right to use a processor for a ready process
c) The context that is the information required for process execution
d) The determination of the order of execution for each process
? 
b) The allocation of the right to use a processor for a ready process
### Explanation:

a) **Incorrect**
- The process described is **multitasking**, where the operating system switches between tasks quickly to give the appearance of simultaneous execution.
c) **Incorrect**
- This refers to the **process control block (PCB)**, which holds the state and context information of a process.
d) **Incorrect**
- This refers to **scheduling**, which simply executes the decisions made by the scheduler.
b) **Correct**
- The ***dispatcher*** is responsible for the actual handover of CPU control from one process to another, allocating the processor to a process that is ready to run.
