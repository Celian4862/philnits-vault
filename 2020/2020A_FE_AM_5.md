In machine learning, which of the following is an appropriate explanation of supervised learning?
a) Clusterizing input data according to the statistical features or specific conditions of the data without any explicit processing beforehand
b) Learning to achieve the highest score from rating good and bad aspects of individual actions
c) Predicting a subsequent user action from the frequency of appearances of behavioral data accumulated from computer users
d) Training by feeding input data and their correct output so that the response to unknown data is improved
? 
d) Training by feeding input data and their correct output so that the response to unknown data is improved
### Explanation:

- In supervised learning, the machine is trained on a labeled dataset, where each training examples consists of an input paired with a correct output (label). The goal for the machine is to map inputs to outputs such that when the machine encounters new unseen data, it can make accurate predictions.
