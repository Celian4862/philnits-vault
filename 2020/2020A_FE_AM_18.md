### Step 1: Break down the problem.

- **Task A** has **high priority**.
- **Task B** has **medium priority**.
- **Task C** has **low priority**.
	- Each task alternates between **CPU** and **I/O operations**.
	- The total execution window we are concerned with is from $3$ ms to $10$ ms ($7$ ms total).

### Step 2: Review the Task Information

![[Pasted image 20241023184645.png]]
- Task **A**, **B**, and **C** start simultaneously at $3$ ms. Our goal is to determine which scheduling diagram correctly represents the process execution.
### Step 3: Apply the concept of Priority Based Scheduling

In **priority scheduling**, the task with the highest priority gets the CPU whenever it is available. If a task is doing I/O, the CPU is allocated to the next highest-priority task that is ready for CPU execution.
- **Task A (High priority)**:
    - Starts at $3$ ms with $2$ ms of CPU time, so it will run from **3 ms to 5 ms**.
    - It will then need I/O for $2$ ms (from **5 ms to 7 ms**), during which the CPU is free for another task.
- **Task B (Medium priority)**:
    - While Task A is doing I/O (from **5 ms to 7 ms**), Task B can start its CPU execution since it has the next highest priority.
    - Task B needs $3$ ms of CPU, but since it can only execute for $2$ ms before Task A is ready to reclaim the CPU, Task B will run from **5 ms to 7 ms**.
    - Task B will now be interrupted to let Task A finish its CPU burst.
- **Task A resumes**:
    - At **7 ms**, Task A finishes its I/O and reclaims the CPU for its final $2$ ms burst. Task A completes at **9 ms**.
- **Task B resumes**:
    - After Task A finishes at $9$ ms, Task B will resume and complete its final $1$ ms of CPU time (since it only ran for 2 ms earlier).
    - Task B completes at **10 ms**.
- **Task C (Low priority)**:
    - Task C can only start its execution once both higher-priority tasks are either in I/O or completed.
    - Task C will start at **7 ms**, as Task A is doing I/O and Task B is running.
    - Task C performs $2$ ms of CPU from **7 ms to 9 ms**, and then will need I/O. However, Task A resumes and finishes before Task C gets a chance to proceed further.

### Step 4: Summarize and Conclude

Summary:
- **From 3 ms to 5 ms**: Task A executes on the CPU.
- **From 5 ms to 7 ms**: Task B executes on the CPU while Task A is doing I/O.
- **At 7 ms**: Task A resumes and completes its remaining CPU execution (from 7 ms to 9 ms).
- **From 7 ms to 9 ms**: Task C starts executing but is interrupted for I/O after 2 ms.
- **At 9 ms**: Task B completes its remaining 1 ms of CPU time.

Therefore, the correct answer is option c because:
- **Task A** runs from **3 to 5 ms (CPU)** and **7 to 9 ms (CPU)**.
- **Task B** runs from **5 to 7 ms (CPU)** and finishes from **9 to 10 ms**.
- **Task C** runs from **7 to 9 ms** and is **then interrupted for I/O**.
