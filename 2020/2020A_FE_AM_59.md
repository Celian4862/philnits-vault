Which of the following is the most appropriate measure that a management executive must take to secure the appearance of independence for an internal system auditor? 

a) Assigning the system auditor to the internal audit department 
b) Making it compulsory for the system auditor to undergo continuous learning of IT 
c) Setting up an auditing-skills training system for the system auditor 
d) Specifying and publishing the knowledge and experience necessary for the system auditor
?
c) The system auditor must make an effort to obtain documents and records that support the information obtained from the department being audited during the interview. 
## **Explanation:**

By placing the system auditor within the internal audit department, it helps ensure that they can operate independently from other departments they may be auditing, thereby enhancing the credibility and objectivity of their work.
### Other Operations

**b)** This is important for the auditor's professional development but does not directly secure their independence in the auditing process.

**c)** While training is beneficial for skill enhancement, it doesn't ensure that the auditor is perceived as independent in their role.

**d)** Defining qualifications is important for transparency and accountability, but it does not directly address the auditor's independence.
