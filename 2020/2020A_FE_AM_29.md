Which of the following is an appropriate explanation of the granularity of locks?
a) When a large number of transactions update the same data, and the granularity is set as large, the number of transactions that can be simultaneously executed increases.
b) When all data in a table are referenced, and the granularity is set as large, data referenced from other transactions can be undisturbed.
c) When data are updated, and the granularity is set as large, the waiting times of other transactions increase, and the total throughput declines.
d) When the granularity is set as large, the number of included data increases, and the number of locks that one transaction makes increases.
? 
c) When data are updated, and the granularity is set as large, the waiting times of other transactions increase, and the total throughput declines.
### Explanation:

a) **Incorrect**
- It's incorrect because large granularity actually reduces the number of transactions that can be executed simultaneously. A larger lock scope means that more data is locked, thereby preventing other transactions from accessing it.
b) **Incorrect**
- The statement is misleading. When granularity is large, other transactions cannot access the locked data, causing disturbances rather than undisturbed access.
d) **Incorrect**
- It's incorrect because a larger granularity means that a single lock may cover more data, which reduces the total number of locks needed, not increases it.
c) **Correct**
- **Granularity of locks** refers to the size or scope of the data that a lock controls. When the granularity is set as large, it can lead to increased waiting times for other transactions because they may be blocked from accessing any part of the locked resource until the lock is released.
