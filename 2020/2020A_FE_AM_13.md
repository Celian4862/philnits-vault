ECC is used for error detection and correction in memory. When n+2 redundant bits are required for a data bus having a width of 2n bits, what is the number of redundant bits that are required for a data bus having a width of 128 bits?
a) 3
b) 8
c) 9
d) 10
? 
c) 9
### Step 1: Express 128 as a power of 2.

Data bits $= 128$
$128 = 2^{7}$

### Step 2: Apply the formula provided.

Number of redundant bits $= n + 2$
$= 7 + 2 = 9$
