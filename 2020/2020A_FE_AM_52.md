The activities and milestones of a project are shown in the arrow diagram below. Which of the following is an impact of reducing the duration of activity, D, by 3 days?

![[Pasted image 20241020014458.png]]
a) Project duration is not changed. 
b) Project duration is reduced by 1 day. 
c) Project duration is reduced by 2 days. 
d) Project duration is reduced by 3 days.
?
b) Project duration is reduced by 1 day. 
## **Explanation:**

To determine the impact of reducing the duration of activity **D** by 3 days, we first need to calculate the **critical path** ( Longest Path ).

### Finding critical path

- Path 1: A → B → E
	- Duration: 6 + 5 + 4 = 15 days
- Path 2: C → D → E
	- Duration: 7 + 5 + 4 = 16 days (**this is the critical path**)
- Path 3: C → F
	- Duration: 7 + 6 = 13 days

Path 2 is the longest and determines the project duration.
### Impact of reducing activity D by 3 days

- Path 2 will be reduced to 13 days
	- **Path 2**: 7 (C) + 2 (D) + 4 (E) = 13 days.

After the reduction, the critical path becomes **Path 1: A → B → E** with 15 days, and the new project duration is reduced by **1 day** (from 16 days to 15 days). Making the answer b) Project duration is reduced by 1 day.
