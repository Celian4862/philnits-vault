Which of the following is the structure that illustrates the relationship between project activity and the units of project that will perform those activities?
**a) Organizational Breakdown Structure 
b) Product Breakdown Structure 
c) Responsibility Assignment Matrix 
d) Work Breakdown Structure**
?
**a) Organizational Breakdown Structure** 
### Explanation
c) can be ruled out as the Responsibility Assignment Matrix only determines the responsibility levels of the organization based on RACI. b) can be ruled out as its about the product, not the project. The difference between Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) and Organizational Breakdown Structure (OBS) is that WBS compartmentalizes/breaks down work into smaller tasks or units, with little to no reference to the relationship with those who will perform the activities. However, OBS utilizes the WBS and groups similar work and relates them to the organization's structure or units. Therefore, a) is our answer.
