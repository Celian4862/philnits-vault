## Choices 

### **a) Connecting the communication cable and the computer through a surge protection device (SPD)** (Correct Answer):

- **Explanation**: A **Surge Protection Device (SPD)** is specifically designed to protect electrical equipment from power surges and spikes, such as those caused by lightning strikes. When a surge occurs, the SPD detects the sudden increase in voltage and either blocks or redirects it safely to the ground, preventing it from reaching sensitive equipment like computers and communication systems. By connecting communication cables and computers through an SPD, you can effectively prevent over-voltage from damaging your system.
- **Why it’s correct**: Lightning strikes can cause significant voltage spikes, which can damage or destroy computer equipment. Installing SPDs ensures that these voltage spikes are safely managed, making it the most appropriate and direct means of protection against such incidents.

### **b) Digitalizing the control circuit of electric power facilities**:

- **Explanation**: Digitalizing control circuits in power facilities involves replacing analog systems with digital ones, which can improve efficiency, monitoring, and control. However, this does not provide any direct protection against over-voltage caused by lightning strikes.
- **Why it’s not correct**: While digitalization might help in other aspects of power management, it does not address the specific issue of protecting equipment from lightning-induced power surges.

### **c) Installing a private power generator**:

- **Explanation**: A **private power generator** provides backup power in case of power outages. It ensures that systems can keep running when the main power supply is interrupted.
- **Why it’s not correct**: A power generator does not protect against over-voltage or power surges caused by lightning strikes. Generators are primarily used to provide continuous power but do not filter or regulate voltage spikes. Therefore, it does not address the problem of over-voltage damage directly.

### **d) Splitting the communication wire into two (2) systems that have different paths**:

- **Explanation**: Splitting communication wires into two systems with different paths involves creating redundant communication lines. This is often done for fault tolerance, ensuring that if one path fails, the other can continue functioning.
- **Why it’s not correct**: While this method can improve network reliability and redundancy, it does not protect against over-voltage caused by lightning. Both communication paths would still be vulnerable to the same surge, and the split itself doesn't mitigate the effects of a lightning strike on the electrical system.

### Summary:

- **a) SPD**: Correct, as it directly protects equipment from voltage surges caused by lightning strikes.
- **b) Digitalizing circuits**: Focuses on modernizing control circuits but doesn’t prevent over-voltage.
- **c) Power generator**: Provides backup power but does not protect against voltage spikes.
- **d) Redundant communication paths**: Improves reliability but doesn't prevent surge damage.
