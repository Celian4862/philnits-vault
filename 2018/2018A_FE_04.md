Which of the following is the computational complexity of the Heapsort algorithm? Here, n is the number of elements to be sorted. All comparisons, swaps, and other needed operations can proceed in constant time.

a) O (log n)
b) O (n)
c) O (n2 )
d) O (n log n)
? 
d) O (n log n)

## Heapsort

Heapsort uses a min/max heap tree as its underlying data structure, so we know that it will include `log n` in its Time Complexity.

We also know that the best comparison-based sorting algorithm (comparing the size of two elements) has `n log n`, so `O(log n)` is impossible.

Therefore, by process of elimination, our answer must be **d) O (n log n)**.
