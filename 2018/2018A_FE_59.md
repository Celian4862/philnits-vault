## Audit Report Findings 

> [!caution] They must be negative things that must be pointed out and fixed after an audit.

### **a) The operator decides a daily operation plan and approves it himself** (Correct Answer):

- **Explanation**: In this scenario, the same person (the operator) is both **creating** and **approving** the daily operation plan, which violates the principle of **segregation of duties**. Segregation of duties is crucial in any organization to ensure that no single person has control over an entire process. This reduces the risk of errors or fraud since different people are responsible for various aspects of decision-making and oversight.
- **Why it’s a finding**: Allowing the operator to both plan and approve the operations creates a risk of unchecked decisions, conflicts of interest, or potential mistakes going unnoticed. In proper operations management, there should be a **separation of roles**—one person should plan, and another should review and approve to ensure accountability. This is a control weakness that auditors would flag as a finding in an audit report.

### **b) The operator records the exception handling that occurs during the operation**:

- **Explanation**: In this case, the operator is documenting exceptions or issues that arise during the operation. Recording exception handling is a good practice and is essential for tracking problems, troubleshooting, and ensuring transparency in operations.
- **Why it’s not a finding**: This is part of the normal operations process and is not a control weakness. In fact, it is encouraged as part of proper system operations to maintain accurate records and track incidents or anomalies.

### **c) The person responsible for operations checks the operation records created by the operator**:

- **Explanation**: Here, the person in charge of operations is reviewing the records created by the operator. This is a form of oversight and control where the person responsible for operations verifies that the records are accurate and consistent with established procedures.
- **Why it’s not a finding**: This reflects proper internal control and segregation of duties. The operator performs the task, and the responsible person reviews and checks it. This reduces the likelihood of errors or fraud and is in line with good operational practices.

### **d) The person responsible for operations stores the operation records by specifying the time period**:

- **Explanation**: In this scenario, the person responsible for operations is managing the storage of operation records with clear specifications of the time period. Proper record storage is essential for auditing, accountability, and future reference.
- **Why it’s not a finding**: This reflects a proper record-keeping process and control. Storing records with specified time periods is good practice for maintaining data integrity and ensuring that records are easily retrievable for audits or reviews. There is no control weakness here.

### Summary of Differences:

- **a)** involves a **lack of segregation of duties**, which is a control weakness that must be reported.
- **b)**, **c)**, and **d)** represent standard, well-managed operational practices, with proper documentation, oversight, and record-keeping.
