Which of the following is an appropriate explanation of SDN (Software-Defined Networking) that uses OpenFlow?

a) It is a business analysis and visualization software technology that uses visual means 
such as data flow diagrams and activity diagrams to discover problems in business 
processes. 
b) It is a network technology that logically decouples the functions for data transfer and 
route control, and is implemented with a combination of network devices specialized for 
data transfer and software-based route control.
c) It is an Internet of Things (IoT) technology that uses RFID, and is a software 
architecture for the optimization of logistics networks. 
d) It is an optimum relocation of servers on a network in order to efficiently deliver a range 
of software content such as music, videos, and online games over the Internet.

b) It is a network technology that logically decouples the functions for data transfer and 
route control, and is implemented with a combination of network devices specialized for 
data transfer and software-based route control.
### What is SDN (Software-Defined Networking)?

**SDN** is an approach to network management that enables dynamic, programmatically efficient network configuration in order to improve network performance and monitoring. The key concept in SDN is the separation of the **control plane** (which decides where traffic is sent) from the **data plane** (which actually forwards traffic to the selected destination).

In traditional networking, both control and data planes are typically integrated into the same hardware (e.g., switches and routers). SDN introduces a new way of networking by allowing these two functions to be **logically decoupled**. This separation allows for centralized control over the network through a software controller, making it more flexible, scalable, and easier to manage.

### OpenFlow Protocol

**OpenFlow** is one of the first and most widely used protocols that implements SDN principles. It allows the SDN controller (software-based) to communicate with network devices like switches and routers, which only handle the **data forwarding** aspect. The controller uses OpenFlow to program the switches on how to forward packets through the network based on predefined rules, such as flow tables.
