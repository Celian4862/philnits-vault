When the development department and operations department of a system are organized separately, which of the following is an appropriate method of smoothly and effectively proceeding with the design and migration of a new service that needs system development?

a) After the completion of the operational test, the development department explains the 
system specifications and operation methods to the operations department. 
b) The development department conducts operational test, creates the operation manuals, 
and passes them over to the operations department. 
c) The operational test is conducted only by the operations department without the support 
of the development department. 
d) The operations department also participates actively in the extraction of requirements 
concerning the system operations. 
? 
d) The operations department also participates actively in the extraction of requirements 
concerning the system operations. 

### **a) After the completion of the operational test, the development department explains the system specifications and operation methods to the operations department.**

- **Explanation**: In this approach, the development team completes the operational test first and then explains how the system works to the operations team.
- **Why it’s not correct**: This method assumes that the operations team gets involved only **after** the development and testing phases are completed. It delays their participation until late in the process, which could lead to misunderstandings or missed requirements, especially in system operations, making it less effective in ensuring smooth collaboration.

### **b) The development department conducts operational test, creates the operation manuals, and passes them over to the operations department.**

- **Explanation**: Here, the development team is responsible for testing the system, creating the operations manuals, and handing them off to the operations department.
- **Why it’s not correct**: This approach also excludes the operations team from active participation during critical stages like testing. The development team might not fully understand all operational requirements, leading to potential issues during system migration or live operations. It creates a disconnect between development and operations, and problems may arise later when the operations team encounters issues not covered in the manuals.

### **c) The operational test is conducted only by the operations department without the support of the development department.**

- **Explanation**: In this option, the operations department conducts the operational testing on its own without any involvement from the development team.
- **Why it’s not correct**: This method places the entire responsibility of testing on the operations team without support from development. Since the development team is familiar with the system's design and architecture, excluding them during testing can lead to gaps in understanding and failure to identify critical issues. Smooth integration requires collaboration, especially during testing.

### **d) The operations department also participates actively in the extraction of requirements concerning the system operations.** (Correct Answer)

- **Explanation**: This approach involves the operations department from the **very beginning**, especially during the extraction of requirements related to system operations. The operations team contributes to defining how the system will be used in practice, helping to design features that will work smoothly in the operational environment.
- **Why it’s correct**: By actively involving the operations department early in the process (during the requirements phase), both teams can ensure that operational concerns are addressed during system design and development. This method aligns with **DevOps principles**, which encourage collaboration between development and operations to reduce silos, improve communication, and increase the likelihood of a successful system migration. This approach also ensures that the operational aspects of the system are considered from the start, leading to fewer issues later on.

### Summary of Differences:

- **a)** and **b)** involve the operations team **too late in the process**, only after the system has been developed and tested. This can lead to issues during implementation because the operations team may not have provided input early enough.
- **c)** puts too much responsibility on the operations team without proper collaboration from the development team, creating inefficiencies.
- **d)** involves both the development and operations teams early on, leading to better communication, more accurate system design, and a smoother transition to operations.
