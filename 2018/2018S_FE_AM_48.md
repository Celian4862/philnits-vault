In order to increase module independence, the level of module coupling must be low. Which of the following methods of exchanging information between modules has the lowest level of module coupling?
**a) Control parameters are passed as arguments in order to control the execution order of modules. 
b) Only data items that are required for input and output are passed as arguments between modules. 
c) Relevant module reference data that is defined in a common area.

### Explanation
Self-explanatory. 
For a longer explanation, Virtualization, division, projection, structuring, normalization, and continuation are all concepts that are present in other areas, or are more advanced concepts related to object orientation. Since the question asks for basic concepts, those listed in a) are the fundamental concepts of object orientation.
