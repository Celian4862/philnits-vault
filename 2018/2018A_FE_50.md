Which of the following is an appropriate testing type to ensure that the interfaces and linkages between different parts of programs work properly?

a) Acceptance test
b) Integration test 
c) Qualification test
d) Unit test 
? 
b) Integration test 


## Integration Test Example

An example of an integration test is when you want to test if your application can properly fetch from an external database server and a data server which contains your data so that your application can send the correct output.

Integration tests are done to ensure that communication across external services or different parts of a system can communicate properly - within expectations.

## Choices 

### 1. **Acceptance Test**:

- **Purpose**: This type of testing ensures that the system meets business requirements and that it works as expected for the end user. Acceptance testing is usually performed after all functional and non-functional testing has been completed.
- **Example**: If a customer is using a new payment system, an acceptance test would ensure that the payment process works as intended from the user's point of view.
- **Key Focus**: It evaluates the system from the user or clientâ€™s perspective to confirm that it satisfies the acceptance criteria before going live.

### 2. **Integration Test** (Correct Answer):

- **Purpose**: This type of testing checks the interfaces and interaction between different modules, components, or external systems. It's used to ensure that these parts work together as intended.
- **Example**: Testing if a web application can correctly interact with both a database server and an external payment gateway to process a transaction.
- **Key Focus**: Ensures that different parts of a system communicate and integrate properly.

### 3. **Qualification Test**:

- **Purpose**: This test is performed to ensure that a product meets specific quality standards or regulatory requirements. Qualification tests are common in industries like aerospace, medical devices, or any sector that requires certification or regulatory approval.
- **Example**: A medical device being tested to meet safety and functional standards for regulatory approval.
- **Key Focus**: Ensuring the product complies with certain standards or criteria required for operation.

### 4. **Unit Test**:

- **Purpose**: A unit test focuses on testing individual components or pieces of code, typically at the function or method level, to ensure they work as expected in isolation.
- **Example**: Testing a single function that adds two numbers to ensure that it returns the correct result.
- **Key Focus**: Verifies the correctness of individual units of code in isolation, without involving other parts of the system.
