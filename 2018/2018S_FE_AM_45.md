Which of the following is an appropriate reason why VLANs are used?
**a) In order to obtain an IP address 
b) In order to reduce network traffic 
c) To remotely access the intranet from a public network 
d) To use a virtual memory system**
?
**b) In order to reduce network traffic** 
### Explanation
IP addresses can be provided without the usage of a VLAN through various methods, such as DHCP. Remote access to intranets from public networks normally requires a private network, such as a VPN. Virtual memory is unrelated to virtual LANs.

Therefore, this leaves us with b), as VLANs are used to segment networks, leading to less strain on the network.
