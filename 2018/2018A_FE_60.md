Which of the following is the most appropriate description concerning an interview that is conducted by a system auditor?

a) The administrator of the audited department, who has experience in auditing tasks, is 
selected as the interviewee. 
b) The entire interview is conducted by one (1) system auditor, because discrepancies may

information obtained from the audited department during the interview. 
? 
d) The system auditor makes an effort to obtain documents and records that support the 
information obtained from the audited department during the interview. 

## Choices 

### a) The administrator of the audited department, who has experience in auditing tasks, is selected as the interviewee.

- **Explanation**: While it can be useful to have knowledgeable individuals in interviews, selecting an administrator who has experience in auditing may introduce bias. This person may not provide an objective view of the department's operations. An auditor typically interviews various staff members to gain a comprehensive understanding.

### b) The entire interview is conducted by one (1) system auditor because discrepancies may occur in the record if multiple auditors are involved.

- **Explanation**: While having a single auditor can help maintain consistency in the interview process, it is not a requirement. In some cases, having multiple auditors can provide a broader perspective and allow for better checks and balances. The potential for discrepancies should be managed through careful documentation and communication, not by restricting the number of auditors.

### c) The system auditor instructs the audited department to take improvement measures for deficiencies found during the interview.

- **Explanation**: This option misrepresents the auditor's role. System auditors typically do not provide directives or instructions during the interview; instead, they assess and document findings. Recommendations for improvement are usually provided in the final audit report after thorough analysis.

### d) The system auditor makes an effort to obtain documents and records that support the information obtained from the audited department during the interview. (Correct)

- **Explanation**: This is the most appropriate description. A critical aspect of auditing is validating information obtained through interviews by cross-referencing it with supporting documents and records. This ensures accuracy and reliability in the audit findings and helps the auditor form a complete picture of the department's operations.
