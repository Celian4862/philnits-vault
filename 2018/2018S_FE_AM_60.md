Which of the following is an appropriate description concerning the implementation of a system audit?
**a) For an audit of the development status of an information systems department, the audit team consists of members of the information systems department who are familiar with the details of the development. 
b) In order to enable the person requesting the audit to issue improvement instructions on the basis of the audit report, the system auditor reports the audit results to the person requesting the audit. 
c) When a system audit is performed as part of an operations audit, the audit team consists of members of the user department. 
d) When a system auditor accepts the help of other experts, the experts become responsible for decisions concerning the scope and methods of support, as well as the audit result.**
?
**b) In order to enable the person requesting the audit to issue improvement instructions on the basis of the audit report, the system auditor reports the audit results to the person requesting the audit.** 
### Explanation
According to ISO 19011:2018: 
_“systematic, independent and documented process for obtaining_ **_objective evidence_** _and evaluating it objectively to determine the extent to which the_ **_audit criteria_** _are fulfilled”_
Following this, it is fair to assume that if audit criteria are not fulfilled, recommendations will be issued to ensure that these criteria will be met. Therefore, b) is the most appropriate answer, as the rest of the choices concern themselves with the structure of the auditing team.
