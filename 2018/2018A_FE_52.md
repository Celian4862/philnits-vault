Which of the following is an appropriate description for group decision-making techniques used in an estimate activity durations process?

a) A group of experts, guided by historical information, can provide duration estimate 
information or recommended maximum activity durations from prior similar projects. 
b) The estimates from such techniques may include contingency reserves, sometimes 
referred to as time reserves or buffers, in the project schedule to account for schedule 
uncertainty. 
c) These are team-based approaches, such as brainstorming, the Delphi or nominal group 
techniques, which are useful for engaging team members to improve estimate accuracy 
and commitment to the emerging estimates. 
d) These techniques use a statistical relationship between historical data and other variables 
to calculate an estimates of activity parameters, such as cost, budget, and duration. 
? 
c) These are team-based approaches, such as brainstorming, the Delphi or nominal group 
techniques, which are useful for engaging team members to improve estimate accuracy 
and commitment to the emerging estimates. 


## Choices 

### a) **A group of experts, guided by historical information, can provide duration estimate information or recommended maximum activity durations from prior similar projects.**

- **Explanation**: This statement describes **expert judgment**, which involves consulting people with experience in similar projects to estimate activity durations based on their past experiences. Experts use historical data as guidance.
- **Why it's not correct**: While expert judgment is useful, it’s not a group decision-making technique. It usually involves a few experts providing input, not a structured group-based approach like brainstorming or Delphi techniques.

### b) **The estimates from such techniques may include contingency reserves, sometimes referred to as time reserves or buffers, in the project schedule to account for schedule uncertainty.**

- **Explanation**: This option refers to the concept of adding **contingency reserves** (buffers) to project estimates to manage uncertainties or risks. This is done to account for potential delays or unforeseen events.
- **Why it's not correct**: Although contingency reserves are important in estimating durations, this option focuses on adding buffer time for risks, not on a group decision-making technique for gathering the estimates themselves.

### **c) These are team-based approaches, such as brainstorming, the Delphi or nominal group techniques, which are useful for engaging team members to improve estimate accuracy and commitment to the emerging estimates.** (Correct) 

- **Explanation**: This option refers to **group decision-making techniques**, which include:
    - **Brainstorming**: Team members collectively discuss and generate ideas or estimates.
    - **Delphi Technique**: A structured communication technique where experts provide estimates independently, and rounds of feedback are provided until a consensus is reached.
    - **Nominal Group Technique**: A group decision-making process where each team member provides input independently, then ranks the ideas collectively to reach a consensus. These methods improve the accuracy of estimates by involving multiple perspectives, and engaging the team increases their commitment to the estimates.
- **Why it's correct**: These approaches specifically describe **group decision-making techniques** that involve team collaboration, which directly aligns with the question's focus on estimate activity durations.

### d) **These techniques use a statistical relationship between historical data and other variables to calculate estimates of activity parameters, such as cost, budget, and duration.**

- **Explanation**: This describes **parametric estimating**, a technique where historical data and mathematical models are used to estimate project parameters (e.g., duration, cost). It involves using a statistical relationship between variables.
- **Why it's not correct**: Parametric estimating is not a group decision-making technique. It’s a quantitative method that uses historical data and mathematical formulas rather than team-based collaboration to make estimates.
