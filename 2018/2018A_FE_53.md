## Critical Path

The **critical path method (CPM)** is a sophisticated project management technique for planning, scheduling, and managing the tasks necessary to complete a project from start to finish. It is also sometimes referred to as **critical path analysis (CPA)**. 

The critical path method does two main things:

1. It helps project managers find the most important tasks in a project that _critically_ affect how long a project will take. 
2. It helps project managers make an efficient schedule so they can finish the entire project on time and within budget.
