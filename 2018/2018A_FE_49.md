Which of the following is an appropriate description concerning the black box test?

a) Even if the program to be tested contains redundant code, such code cannot be detected. 
b) If the number of branch instructions and modules increases, the test data volume 
increases rapidly. 
c) In consideration of the internal structure of the program, it is verified whether or not the 
necessary part is executed. 
d) The coverage rate of instructions and branches is used as criteria for the creation of test 
data. 
? 
a) Even if the program to be tested contains redundant code, such code cannot be detected. 

## Black Box vs White Box Testing

> [!info] We think of a black box as something we cannot look into, so implementation details and code cannot be seen.
> - **We only test the business domain expectations**: "This function must return the product of two numbers", but we do not know if it uses the `*` operator or does multiple additions to accomplish it.
> - Meanwhile, in White Box testing, the developers know the implementation details and they can test multiple "branches" of the function so that they can see if their conditionals can all be reached - to remove redundant code.
