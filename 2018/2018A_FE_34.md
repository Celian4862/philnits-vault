In TCP/IP, which of the following is an application layer protocol that enables a server to automatically configure its clients with network information such as IP addresses, the subnet mask and the default gateway address?

a) ARP
b) DHCP
c) DNS
d) NSLOOKUP
? 
b) DHCP

## DHCP

> [!info] Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol
> It's used to lease IP Addresses to devices that connect to networks so that the administrator does not need to manually input the device's IP address and subnet masks, default gateway, etc.

## Other Choices 

### ARP

This is the "Address Resolution Protocol" used to allow Layer 2 devices to find a destination by broadcasting to the entire network on 255.255.255.255.

### DNS

This is "Domain Name System" and is used to transform plaintext domain names to their corresponding IP addresses.


### NSLOOKUP

It is a CLI tool to find the IP address of a domain via DNS.

A sample usage is `nslookup website.com 8.8.8.8`, where `website.com` is the site you want to find the IP Address for and `8.8.8.8` is the domain name server. In our case, it's Google's DNS.
