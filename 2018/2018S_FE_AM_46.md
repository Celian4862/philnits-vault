Which of the following must be approved by the customer when the external design of a system is completed?
**a) Physical database specification
b) Program flowchart
c) Screen layout 
d) System development plan**
?
**c) Screen layout** 
### Explanation
As program flowcharts, system development plans, and physical database specifications are all internal or system designs, the customer normally has little to no reason to approve or disapprove of the design due to lack of technical expertise. Screen layouts are external and easily seen and understood by the customer, in this sense, the customer can approve or disapprove of the layout as technical expertise is not needed to review the screen layout. c) is our answer for this reason.
