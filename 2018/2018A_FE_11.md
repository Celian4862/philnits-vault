c) Indirect Addressing

## Choices

### a) **Direct Addressing**:

- **Explanation**: In **direct addressing**, the address field in the instruction directly refers to the memory location where the data is stored.
- **Example**: If the address field is 20, the instruction would directly access memory location 20 to retrieve the data.
- **Is this the answer?**: No, because in the figure, the address field points to location 20, but this does **not** contain the actual data. Instead, it contains a pointer to another address (25), where the data is found.

### b) **Indexed Addressing**:

- **Explanation**: In **indexed addressing**, the address of the operand is determined by adding a constant value (index) to the contents of an index register. This is often used for accessing elements in an array.
- **Example**: If the base address is 20 and the index is 5, the effective address would be 25.
- **Is this the answer?**: No, there is no indication of an index being added in this diagram. The address 25 is directly given by the value in memory location 20.

### c) **Indirect Addressing**:

- **Explanation**: In **indirect addressing**, the address field of the instruction refers to a memory location (like 20), which does not contain the actual data but rather the address (like 25) where the data is stored. This is a form of **pointer-based addressing**.
- **Is this the answer?**: **Yes**, this is exactly what the diagram shows. The instruction points to address 20, which contains the address 25, and 25 holds the actual data.

### d) **Relative Addressing**:

- **Explanation**: In **relative addressing**, the address of the operand is determined by adding a constant value (offset) to the current value of the program counter (PC).
- **Example**: If the program counter is at address 100 and the instruction has a relative offset of 20, the effective address would be 120.
- **Is this the answer?**: No, the diagram does not show any relation to the program counter or an offset. The address 25 is reached through indirect addressing.

### **Conclusion**:

The correct answer is **c) Indirect addressing**, because the instruction points to a memory location (20), which contains another memory address (25) where the actual data is located.
