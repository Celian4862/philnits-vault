Which of the following is a special purpose register that stores the result of a comparison 
or the sign of the result of an arithmetic operation? 

a) Accumulator
b) Flags register 
c) Instruction register
d) Program counter
? 
b) Flags register 

## Choices 
### a) **Accumulator**:

- **Description**: The **accumulator** is a general-purpose register used in the arithmetic logic unit (ALU) of a CPU to store intermediate results during arithmetic and logic operations. It holds operands and results of operations temporarily.
- **Context**: While it stores the results of operations, it does not specifically store the outcome of a comparison or information like the sign or zero status. That is the role of the **flags register**.

### b) **Flags Register** (Correct Answer):

- **Description**: The **flags register** (also called the **status register** or **condition code register**) is a special-purpose register in the CPU that stores information about the outcome of arithmetic or logical operations. It holds **flags** (bits) that represent conditions like:
    - **Zero flag** (Z): Set if the result of an operation is zero.
    - **Sign flag** (S): Set if the result of an operation is negative.
    - **Carry flag** (C): Set if there’s a carry out (in addition) or borrow (in subtraction).
    - **Overflow flag** (O): Set if an arithmetic overflow occurs.
- **Context**: These flags are crucial in making decisions during conditional operations (e.g., branching, conditional jumps).

### c) **Instruction Register**:

- **Description**: The **instruction register** (IR) is a register that holds the instruction currently being executed by the CPU. It temporarily stores the instruction fetched from memory before it is decoded and executed.
- **Context**: It doesn’t store the result of a comparison or information like the sign of an arithmetic operation.

### d) **Program Counter**:

- **Description**: The **program counter** (PC) is a register that holds the address of the next instruction to be executed by the CPU. It increments automatically after each instruction is executed unless a control transfer (e.g., a jump) occurs.
- **Context**: It tracks the instruction sequence and doesn't store comparison results or arithmetic operation outcomes.
