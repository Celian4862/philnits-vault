Which of the following is an appropriate cost estimation technique that uses parametric 
models to create an objective estimate based on each element size and the complexity of 
the system (e.g., number of input files, screens, etc.) to be built? 

a) Analogous estimating
b) Bottom-up estimating 
c) Function point method
d) Three-point estimating 
? 
c) Function point method


## Choices 

### **a) Analogous Estimating**:

- **Explanation**: Analogous estimating, also called **top-down estimating**, involves using the actual cost or duration of similar past projects (or activities within projects) to estimate the cost or duration of the current project. It relies on historical data and expert judgment to draw comparisons.
- **Example**: If a previous project took 6 months and $100,000 to complete, a new project of similar scope might be estimated to take the same.
- **Why it’s not correct**: Analogous estimating does not focus on parametric models or system complexity but rather on using past projects as reference points.

### **b) Bottom-up Estimating**:

- **Explanation**: Bottom-up estimating involves breaking down the project into smaller components or activities and estimating the cost or duration of each activity individually. These individual estimates are then rolled up to calculate the total project cost or duration.
- **Example**: Estimating the cost for every single task in a software project (e.g., coding, testing, debugging) and adding them together to get a total project estimate.
- **Why it’s not correct**: Bottom-up estimating is more granular and time-consuming and doesn’t use parametric models or focus on system complexity.

### **c) Function Point Method** (Correct Answer):

- **Explanation**: The **function point method** is a parametric cost estimation technique that quantifies the size of a system based on its functional components, like inputs, outputs, user interactions (screens), and files. It assesses complexity by counting these elements and applying weights based on their complexity. This method is commonly used in software development to estimate effort, cost, and time.
- **Example**: Estimating the cost of developing a software system by analyzing how many input files, reports, user interfaces (screens), and external interactions are required, then applying standard complexity-based multipliers to get an estimate.
- **Why it’s correct**: The function point method uses a parametric model to create objective estimates based on the size and complexity of the system, making it appropriate for the scenario described in the question.

### **d) Three-Point Estimating**:

- **Explanation**: Three-point estimating involves calculating three different estimates for a task: the **optimistic** (best-case scenario), **pessimistic** (worst-case scenario), and **most likely** estimates. These three estimates are then combined, often using a weighted average (such as the PERT formula), to account for uncertainty and risk.
- **Example**: Estimating that a task will take 4 days in the best case, 10 days in the worst case, and 6 days most likely, then calculating an average estimate.
- **Why it’s not correct**: Three-point estimating deals with uncertainty by considering different scenarios, but it doesn’t rely on parametric models or focus on system complexity.

### Summary of Differences:

- **Analogous estimating**: Uses historical data from similar projects.
- **Bottom-up estimating**: Breaks the project into small pieces and estimates each one individually.
- **Function point method**: Uses parametric models to estimate based on the system's functional size and complexity (correct answer).
- **Three-point estimating**: Accounts for uncertainty by considering optimistic, pessimistic, and most likely scenarios.
