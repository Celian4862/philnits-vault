Which of the following is the method that uses a modeling tool to create a design document described with E-R diagrams or other representations from the definition information in an active database?
**a) Concurrent engineering
b) Forward engineering
c) Reverse engineering 
d) Social engineering**
?
**c) Reverse engineering** 
### Explanation
Social Engineering and Concurrent Engineering can be ruled out as social engineering is a security concept, and the concurrent engineering is parallel. Forward Engineering is defined as creating a new system based on given specifications, which doesn't apply to the question as there is no active database. Therefore we are left with c), Reverse Engineering. Reverse Engineering in a database framework is creating a design document or model using a blank model based on information in an active system.
