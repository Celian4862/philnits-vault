Which of the following is a module strength for the collection of multiple sequential functions, with internal passing of data?

a) Communicational strength
b) Functional strength 
c) Informational strength
d) Procedural strength
? 
a) Communicational strength

### Explanation

- **Communicational strength** refers to a module where the components (functions or procedures) are related because they work on the same data. These functions are grouped together because they perform operations on the same input data or contribute to processing a piece of information that needs to be passed between them.

In this case, the functions are dependent on each other for passing data between them internally, which is what gives the module communicational strength.


## Other Choices

- **Functional strength**: All the functions in the module contribute to a single, well-defined task or goal.
    
- **Informational strength**: The module encapsulates data, and different functions in the module operate on different pieces of that data, without necessarily interacting with each other.
    
- **Procedural strength**: The functions in the module are grouped because they need to follow a specific sequence of steps, not necessarily because they work on the same data.
