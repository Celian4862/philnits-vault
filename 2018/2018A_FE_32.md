Which of the following is the most appropriate information for a router to determine the destination of an incoming packet?

a) Destination IP address
b) Destination MAC address
c) Source IP address
d) Source MAC address
? 
a) Destination IP address

## Mental Framework

Routers work in the 3rd layer of the OSI Model (Network Layer), so they deal with IP Addresses, hence a) is our answer.

MAC Addresses, on the other hand, are for the 2nd layer (Data Link layer).
