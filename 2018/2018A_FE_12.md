## Solution

To determine the minimum number of signal lines required for the address bus, we need to calculate the total number of possible memory addresses.

**1. Calculate the total number of bytes in the memory:**

- 1 megabyte = 1,024 kilobytes
- 1 kilobyte = 1,024 bytes
- So, 1 megabyte = 1,024 * 1,024 bytes = 1,048,576 bytes

**2. Determine the number of bits needed to represent this number of addresses:**

- We need to find the smallest integer n such that 2^n >= 1,048,576.
- By trial and error, we find that 2^20 = 1,048,576.

**3. The number of bits equals the number of signal lines:**

- Therefore, the minimum number of signal lines required for the address bus is **20**.

**So, the correct answer is (c) 20.**
