b) 9

### Step 1: Calculate the total coding effort (in person-days)

We need to calculate how many person-days are required for coding each type of program and then sum them up:

1. **Input processing**:
   - Number of programs: 20
   - Person-days per program: 1  
   $\text{Total for input processing} = 20 \times 1 = 20 \text{ person-days}$

2. **Output processing**:
   - Number of programs: 10
   - Person-days per program: 3  
   $\text{Total for output processing} = 10 \times 3 = 30 \text{ person-days}$

3. **Calculation processing**:
   - Number of programs: 5
   - Person-days per program: 9  
   $\text{Total for calculation processing} = 5 \times 9 = 45 \text{ person-days}$

#### Total coding effort:
$\text{Total coding person-days} = 20 + 30 + 45 = 95 \text{ person-days}$

### Step 2: Calculate the design and testing effort

According to the problem, design and testing activities require **8 times as many person-days** as coding.

$\text{Design and testing person-days} = 8 \times 95 = 760 \text{ person-days}$

### Step 3: Calculate the total effort

The total effort required to develop the system is the sum of the coding effort and the design and testing effort:

$\text{Total effort} = 95 \text{ (coding)} + 760 \text{ (design and testing)} = 855 \text{ person-days}$


### Step 4: Calculate the minimum number of staff members

We need to complete the project in **95 days**, and the total effort is **855 person-days**. To find the number of staff members required, we divide the total effort by the number of days:

$\text{Number of staff members} = \frac{855 \text{ person-days}}{95 \text{ days}} = 9 \text{ staff members}$

---

### Final Answer:
The minimum number of staff members required is **9**. Therefore, the correct answer is **b) 9**.
