Which of the following is a feature of a switching hub (layer 2 switch) network device?

a) It breaks a received packet into smaller pieces (fragments) in the network layer. 
b) It dynamically allocates an IP address for a terminal connected to its LAN port. 
c) It forwards a received packet only to its LAN port connected to a device with the 
packet’s destination MAC address. 
d) It forwards a received packet to all its LAN ports (broadcast). 
? 
c) It forwards a received packet only to its LAN port connected to a device with the 
packet’s destination MAC address. 

This is because layer 2 devices deal with MAC Addresses, while layer 3 devices deal with IP Addresses.

d) is wrong because it will only forward the packet to the broadcast MAC address `FFFF.FFFF.FFFF` or `ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff` on the specific pretense that
- it doesn't know the MAC address of the destination (not stored in its MAC table).
- the packet is meant to be received by all devices in the network.
