There is communication data that consists of five characters “A”, “B”, “C”, “D”, and “E” 
that have different appearance frequencies, and in order to compress the data by using 
Huffman coding, the code table shown below is created. Which of the following is an 
appropriate code that should be inserted in the blank?

a) 001
b) 010
c) 101
d) 110
? 
d) 110
### Video Tutorial on Huffman Coding

It's a strategy of compressing data for JPEG and MPEG files. There's a process to it so watching this tutorial: [Text Compression with Huffman Coding - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iiGZ947Tcck) is more helpful than me discussing it.

> [!tip] It uses less data (lets digits) for more common characters.
