? 
b) 7,600
## Solution

Since this company does first-in-first-out (FIFO) for inventory asset valuation, this means that the older inventory gets sold first before new ones.

So based on the table, we sold 400 units.

We need to subtract from our units based on what was procured first.

1. 400 - 100 (10 unit price) = 300
2. 300 - 300 (14 unit price) = 0

So now, we are left with

- 200 (14 unit price)
- 400 (12 unit price)

Now, we can simply do $(200 \times 14) + (400 \times 12) = 2800 + 4800 = 7600$

Therefore, out **answer is b) 7,600**.
