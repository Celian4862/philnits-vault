Which of the following is a characteristic of an IC tag (RFID)?

a) It handles a large amount of information. Thus it uses an external storage device for 
storing information. 
b) It is stain-resistant, and recorded information can be read from the outside of the 
package. 
c) It is used by inserting the tag into a dedicated magnetic reader.
d) It uses GPS to display location information or attribute information about the current 
location.
? 
b) It is stain-resistant, and recorded information can be read from the outside of the 
package. 

## Mental Framework

Your ID is an RFID and it can have stickers and can get dirty, but it will still work. This is because the reader (in the school portals) sends power to the RFID receiver, which is a small Integrated Circuit (IC) embedded in your ID.

Therefore, your RFID tag is stain-resistant and the data can be read outside the package (ID) it's embedded in.

## What is RFID?

Tagging items with [RFID tags](https://www.atlasrfidstore.com/rfid-tags/) allows users to automatically and uniquely identify and track inventory and assets. RFID uses radio waves sent via an RFID antenna to RFID tags in the surrounding area.

Examples of applications that benefit from RFID are endless. Applications extend from broad areas like inventory tracking to supply chain management and can become more specialized depending on the company or industry. Types of RFID applications can span from IT asset tracking to textile tracking and even into specifics like rental item tracking.

### What is an RFID Tag?

> [!info] An RFID tag in its most simplistic form, is comprised of [two parts](https://rfid.atlasrfidstore.com/parts-of-a-tag/)
> - an antenna for transmitting and receiving signals,
> - and an RFID chip (or integrated circuit, IC) which stores the tag’s ID and other information.
> 
> RFID tags are affixed to items in order to track them using an RFID reader and antenna.


RFID tags typically do not have a battery (unless specified as Active or BAP tags); instead, they [receive energy](https://www.atlasrfidstore.com/rfid-insider/rf-physics/) from the radio waves generated by the reader.

When the RFID tag receives the transmission from the reader/antenna, the energy runs through the internal antenna to the tag’s chip.

The energy activates the RFID chip, which modulates the energy with the desired information, and then transmits a signal back toward the antenna/reader.

> [!tip] This makes RFIDs very good at working even if the card is scratched or obstructed, because the IC (integrated circuit) still works and can receive the radio frequencies needed to verify the data.
