When the series of stack operations below is performed on an empty stack, which of the following is the data that is read out by the last READ operation? Here, “PUSH x” is the operation to put data x in the stack, “POP” is used to retrieve data from the stack, and “READ” is used to read data from the top of the stack without removing the original data.

PUSH 2 → READ → PUSH 3 → PUSH 6 → POP → READ → PUSH 4 →READ → PUSH 7 → PUSH 5→ POP → POP → READ

a) 2
b) 3
c) 4
d) 6
?
c) 4

### Let's Solve This Step By Step

Let's say our stack grows from left to right, where right is the top-most element.

So our empty stack is `x = {}`.

1. PUSH 2 `{ 2 }`
2. READ `{ 2 }` outputs 2
3. PUSH 3 `{ 2, 3 }`
4. PUSH 6 `{ 2, 3, 6 }`
5. POP `{ 2, 3 }`
6. READ `{ 2, 3 }` outputs 3
7. PUSH 4 `{ 2, 3, 4 }`
8. READ `{ 2, 3, 4 }` outputs 4
9. PUSH 7 `{ 2, 3, 4, 7 }`
10. PUSH 5 `{ 2, 3, 4, 7, 5 }`
11. POP `{ 2, 3, 4, 7 }`
12. POP `{ 2, 3, 4 }`
13. READ `{ 2, 3, 4 }` outputs 4

As we can see, we are trying to find the result of the "last READ operation", which outputs 4, so that is our answer: c) 4.
