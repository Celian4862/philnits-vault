? 
a) StudentNumber HAVING AVG(Score) >= 80

This means, we group all scores of the student by their `StudentNumber`, then we `AVG()` all of it, per student.

Afterwards, we use the `HAVING AVG(Score) >= 80` to only show `group, AVG()` rows that have `AVG(Score) >= 80`.

## Aggregate SQL Functions 

The `GROUP BY <attr>` clause selects rows having a common attribute value `<attr>` into a smaller set of rows.
- **typically used with aggregate functions** 
- for example, `SELECT item_name, SUM(price) FROM items GROUP BY item_name` will sum all the prices of each item, then group the `item_name` column to their corresponding `SUM(price)`.

## Discussing Alternatives

b) is wrong because `WHERE` does not apply to `GROUP BY`, but rather on the initial `SELECT StudentNumber`.

c) is wrong because we are trying to average the `StudentNumber` scores, not the entire `Subject`.

d) is wrong because of the same reason b) is wrong and we are not looking to average the `Subject` scores, but rather the `StudentNumber` scores.
