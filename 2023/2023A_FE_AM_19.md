Which of the following is an explanation of the function of an archiver that is one of the data management utilities?

a) Compiling several files into one file or reconstructing the original files in order to 
perform data backup and distribution 
b) Creating both an area for recording data and an area for managing data on a single hard 
disk 
c) Keeping data secure through file protection for safeguarding data from unauthorized use 
and destruction, and also through copy protection for preventing unauthorized copying 
d) Rearranging a file into contiguous areas, to the extent possible, on a hard disk in which 
fragmentation has occurred
? 
a) Compiling several files into one file or reconstructing the original files in order to 
perform data backup and distribution

## Analogy

You know how in `.zip` file management tools like 7z and WinRAR, you can select multiple files and click "Add to archive"? Afterwards, it compresses and groups your files into a single `.zip` file so that it's easier to transfer and compress?

Yeah, that's basically what a) is doing. We are "archiving" files into a single file to be easily moved or compressed into a smaller format, which we can "Extract" or reconstruct to the originals if we need to.
