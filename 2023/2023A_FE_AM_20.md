# 2023A_FE_AM_20 %% ex. 2024S_FE-A_83 %%

Which of the following is a sequential circuit that has two stable states?

a) Adder circuit
b) Capacitor
c) Flip-flop
d) NAND gate
? 
c) Flip-flop

## What is a Flip-Flop

A flip-flop in digital electronics is a circuit with **two stable states that can be used to store binary data.**

The stored data can be changed by applying varying inputs.

Flip-flops and latches are fundamental building blocks of digital electronics systems used in computers, communications, and many other types of systems. Both are used as **data storage elements**.

## Why the Others Are Wrong

- **a) Adder circuit**: An adder circuit performs arithmetic operations like addition but does not have stable states. It is a combinational circuit, meaning it doesn't store data but rather computes outputs based on current inputs.
    
- **b) Capacitor**: A capacitor is a passive electronic component that stores electric charge temporarily, but it does not have defined binary states in the context of a digital circuit like flip-flops do.
    
- **d) NAND gate**: A NAND gate is a basic logic gate used in digital circuits to perform a logical operation. It's a combinational circuit that produces an output based on its current inputs, but it doesn’t have memory or stable states like a flip-flop.
