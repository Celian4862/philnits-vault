Which of the following is a method that restores the system to its initial state and restarts it when a system failure occurs, that does not accompany preprocessing of a copy before/after an update, and that is also called initial program load?

a) Cold start
b) Rollback
c) Rollforward
d) Warm start
? 
a) Cold start


## Cold Start

It happens when the server, container, PC, device, etc. is turned off and it needs to power up & load your application.

This matches the question description about "initial program load". so **a) Cold Start** is our answer.

## Other Answers

### **b) Rollback**

- **Rollback** refers to reverting a system to a previous state by undoing recent changes, usually after a failure or bug. This process often involves restoring data or configurations from backups or logs.
- While this can be part of a recovery plan, it specifically deals with undoing updates rather than restoring a system to its initial state and performing an **initial program load**. It’s not about restarting the system from scratch, but rather undoing changes.

### **c) Rollforward**

- **Rollforward** is the opposite of rollback. It refers to applying changes from transaction logs or other updates to move a system forward to a point after the last backup, effectively "catching up" with changes that occurred after the last backup.
- This process assumes that the system is already in an operational state and is usually used in the context of database recovery or logs. It doesn’t refer to restoring a system to its original state from scratch, nor does it involve the "initial program load."

### **d) Warm start**

- A **warm start** is when the system restarts or reboots but retains certain parts of its state or data. It might reuse existing data structures or caches from a previous state. While a warm start is faster and doesn’t load everything from scratch, it doesn't fully revert the system to its initial state as a cold start does.
- This means that the system isn’t truly starting from scratch, and some preprocessing might be involved. So this doesn’t fully align with "restoring to initial state" as described in the question.
