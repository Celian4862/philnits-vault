Which of the following is an explanation of a smart grid?

a) It is a system that aims at the utilization of recyclable energy, supply of stable electric 
power, and optimum demand adjustment through the integrated control of power 
generation and power consumption on the basis of communication and information-processing technology. 
b) It is a system that can provide ideal health advice to each individual by performing 
analysis on the basis of similar case reports such as the result of health examinations and 
medication use. 
c) It is a system that can search for information on restaurants and entertainment, send and 
receive traffic information, and communicate the current position at the time of an 
emergency by using information-processing equipment installed in vehicles. 
d) It is a system that supports varied work styles by enabling mutual communication 
between workers with varied working styles, such as home-based employees and senior 
workers.

## Smart Grid

> [!info] Smart grids are electricity network that use digital technologies, sensors and software to better match the supply and demand of electricity in real time while minimizing costs and maintaining the stability and reliability of the grid.

> [!tip] You can think of it as a "Smart Power Grid" - which can optimize the distribution of power in the grid.

## Other Choices 

### a) **Smart Grid** (Correct Answer)

- A **smart grid** is a modern electricity network that uses communication and information technology to optimize the generation, distribution, and consumption of electric power. It integrates renewable energy sources like solar and wind, helps balance energy demand with supply, and ensures more efficient and stable power delivery.
- **Example**: A smart grid might adjust energy usage in homes and businesses during peak hours to prevent blackouts and improve energy efficiency by using real-time data from connected devices.

### b) **Health Information System**

- This option describes a **health information system** or **personalized healthcare system** that provides customized health advice based on analysis of medical data like health examination results and medication history. These systems often use AI or data analytics to improve healthcare outcomes for individuals.
- **Example**: A system that analyzes a patient's medical history and provides personalized recommendations for diet, exercise, and medication based on similar cases.

### c) **Vehicle Information System (Telematics)**

- This refers to **vehicle information systems** or **telematics**, which provide various services related to navigation, traffic updates, and emergency assistance. Such systems can also track the location of the vehicle and communicate it in case of emergencies.
- **Example**: A carâ€™s navigation system that provides real-time traffic updates and can send an SOS with the vehicle's location during an accident.

### d) **Teleworking/Collaboration System**

- This describes a **teleworking or collaboration system** that enables communication and collaboration between workers with different working styles, such as remote workers or senior workers. These systems help people work together efficiently, even if they are not physically in the same location.
- **Example**: Tools like **Zoom** or **Microsoft Teams** that allow employees to communicate and collaborate effectively, regardless of their location or work schedule.
