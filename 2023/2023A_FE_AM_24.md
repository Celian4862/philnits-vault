### ### Key Processes in PCM:

PCM involves three key steps to convert an analog signal (like an audio signal) into a digital signal:

1. **Sampling**:
    
    - The analog signal is sampled at regular intervals. In this step, the continuous analog signal is measured at discrete points in time.
    - **Purpose**: To capture the signalâ€™s amplitude (value) at these regular intervals.
2. **Quantization**:
    
    - After sampling, the analog values are rounded to the nearest value within a range of discrete levels. This process introduces a small error called "quantization noise."
    - **Purpose**: To convert the sampled values into a finite set of values for easier digital representation.
3. **Encoding**:
    
    - The quantized values are converted into a binary format (0s and 1s).
    - **Purpose**: To represent the data in digital form for storage, transmission, or processing.


## The Answer

d) Sampling matches the description of the question to capture analog signals at regular intervals.
