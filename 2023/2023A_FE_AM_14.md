ECC is used for error detection and correction in memory. When n+2 redundant bits are required for a data bus having a width of $2^n$ bits, what is the number of redundant bits that are required for a data bus having a width of 128 bits?

a) 3
b) 8
c) 9
d) 10
? 
c) 9

## What is ECC?

It is an acronym for "Error Code Correction" and it's used to pinpoint error codes by using multiple parity bits laid out the block of bits.

## Solving the Problem

We can solve this problem with algebra because everything is given already in the question.

Given:
- We need n+2 redundant bits for our data bus
- Our data bus size formula is $2^n$
- Our desired data bus size is 128 bits

Asked:
- How many redundant bits should we allocate for our Data Bus of 128 bits?

Solution:
1. First, we find n, so we do $2^n = 128$.
	- what power of $2$ allows us to get 128? Yes, it's 7, so $n = 7$.
2. We can now substitute $n+2$ so that $7 + 2 = 9$, meaning we need $9$ redundant bits for our data bus of size $2^n$.
3. Our answer is **c) 9**
