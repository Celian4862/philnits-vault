When an order data in the format shown below is entered, which of the following is a data validation method that is performed to determine whether the order date is a business day and whether the date is on or before the date of data entry or after the date of data entry?

a) Duplicate check
b) Format check
c) Logical check
d) Sequence check
? 
c) Logical check

## Data Validation Checks

Here's a summary of checks thanks to our AI friend:

### 1. **Duplicate Check**

- **Purpose**: To ensure that data is not entered more than once, avoiding redundancy.
- **Example**: A system checks whether a customer’s ID or order number already exists before allowing new entry.

### 2. **Format Check**

- **Purpose**: To ensure that the data entered follows a specific format or pattern.
- **Example**: A date field must follow the format "YYYY-MM-DD", or a phone number must have a specific number of digits.

### 3. **Range Check**

- **Purpose**: To verify that data falls within a specified range.
- **Example**: A temperature field might only accept values between -50°C and 50°C, or a quantity field must be between 1 and 1000.

### 4. **Length Check**

- **Purpose**: To ensure that data has a specific number of characters.
- **Example**: A password field requires at least 8 characters, or a ZIP code must have exactly 5 digits.

### 5. **Presence Check**

- **Purpose**: To ensure that a field has been filled and is not left blank.
- **Example**: Mandatory fields like a customer’s name or address should not be empty.

### 6. **Logical Check**

- **Purpose**: Verifies that data makes sense in its context and adheres to logical rules or business constraints.
- **Example**: Checking that an order date isn't in the future or that a delivery date isn't earlier than the order date.

### 7. **Consistency Check**

- **Purpose**: To check that data is consistent across different fields or systems.
- **Example**: The shipping address country must match the customer’s country of residence, or a "start date" must precede the "end date."

### 8. **Sequence Check**

- **Purpose**: To ensure that records are in the correct order.
- **Example**: In a booking system, flight legs should follow the sequence from the departure city to the destination.

### 9. **Check Digit Validation**

- **Purpose**: To validate codes using an additional digit calculated based on the others.
- **Example**: Credit card numbers often have a check digit at the end to verify the accuracy of the number.

### 10. **Type Check**

- **Purpose**: To ensure that the data entered is of the correct data type (e.g., text, number, date).
- **Example**: A price field must contain only numeric data, while a name field should not contain numbers.

### 11. **Uniqueness Check**

- **Purpose**: To ensure that a field contains unique values across records.
- **Example**: An email address or username should be unique to each user.

## Discussing the Answer

Our answer is c) because we need to make the data adhere to multiple business logic constraints. 

You might have answered d) because the last part of the problem talks about order "or after the date of data entry", but it has other clauses it must fulfill, hence why it should be a business logic check.
