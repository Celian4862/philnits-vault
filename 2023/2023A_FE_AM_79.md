1. **Operating Activities**: Cash flows from core business activities, like receiving payments from customers or paying suppliers.
2. **Investing Activities**: Cash flows related to acquiring or selling long-term assets like property or investments.
3. **Financing Activities**: Cash flows from transactions involving the company’s own equity and debt, such as issuing stock, borrowing money, or repaying loans.
