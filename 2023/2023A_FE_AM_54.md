## What is Critical Path in Project Management?

Also called critical path analysis (CPA), the critical path method (CPM) is a technique where you identify tasks that are necessary for project completion and determine scheduling flexibilities.

A critical path in project management is the **longest sequence of activities that must be finished on time in order for the entire project to be complete**.
- Any delays in critical tasks will delay the whole project.

## Finding the Answer

Based on the choices, we find the number of days required for all of them, by summing all the numbers for each path.

a) $A\to B\to E \to I \to L = 2 + 3 + 1 + 2 + 3 = 11$
b) $A \to C \to D \to E \to H \to K = 2 + 3 + 1 + 1 + 3 + 2 = 12$
c) $A \to C \to F \to I \to L = 2 + 3 + 3 + 2 + 3 = 13$
d) $A \to C \to G \to J \to L = 2 + 3 + 4 + 2 + 3 = 14$

As we can see, d) takes the longest and is therefore the Critical Path for this Arrow Diagram.
