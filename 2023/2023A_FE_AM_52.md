This indicates that fewer new bugs are being found per test item, suggesting a stabilizing quality condition.

## What Constitutes Stable Quality?

**A stable quality condition** means that the rate of new bugs being discovered is decreasing as more test items are completed.

> [!tip] When a bug is discovered, making a test documents and stops it, but doesn't remove it from the cumulative calculation.
> - cumulative means past number of bugs are still being included in the sum.
> 	- `[1, 2, 0, 0]` the cumulative sum is still 3, not `0`, despite no more bugs being in the system.


## Other Choices 

- **A)** shows a rapid decrease in the cumulative number of bugs, which is unrealistic as bugs are typically discovered throughout the testing process.
- **B)** shows a continuous increase in the cumulative number of bugs at a relatively constant rate, indicating no improvement in quality.
- **C)** shows a linear relationship between the number of completed test items and the cumulative number of bugs, suggesting a constant rate of bug discovery, which is not indicative of a stable quality condition.
