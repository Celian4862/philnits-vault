## Mental Framework

Have you ever checked your FPS? Have you ever watched those YouTube graphics card benchmark videos to compare the GPU to others in order to pick the best one or make an informed buyer decision?

That's basically what benchmarking is.

> [!info] Benchmarking is a process that involves **measuring the performance of your business against a competitor in the same market**. This will give you a better understanding of your business performance and potential.
> - In dictionary terms, it is to "evaluate or check (something) by comparison with a standard."

So in our answer 

- a) It refers to a qualitative and quantitative understanding of a company’s own products, services, and operation through comparison with those of competitors or advanced companies.

We are trying to set a standard of a company's products, services, and operations in order to compare or benchmark them with competitors or advanced companies.

## Other Choices

### b) **Business Process Reengineering (BPR)**

- This refers to the concept of **Business Process Reengineering (BPR)**, which involves **drastically redesigning** a company’s core processes with a focus on improving customer satisfaction and operational efficiency through innovative use of information technology.
- **BPR** is about **reforming** and **restructuring** the way a business operates, often leading to fundamental changes in workflows.
- **Example**: A company might completely redesign its order fulfillment process to reduce the delivery time from weeks to days.

### c) **Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP)**

- This option describes **Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP)**, which is the ability to manage and integrate core business processes using a centralized system. It helps in **planning and managing resources** (like finance, human resources, and supply chain) effectively across the organization.
- The focus here is on improving the management and allocation of resources to boost efficiency, rather than comparing the company’s performance to others (which is benchmarking).
- **Example**: Using an ERP system like **SAP** or **Oracle** to streamline company-wide data across departments to improve decision-making and management efficiency.

### d) **Core Competency Strategy**

- This refers to the **core competency strategy**, which involves focusing a company’s resources on areas where it has unique skills, knowledge, or capabilities that offer a competitive advantage and can generate profit.
- A company’s **core competencies** are what it does better than its competitors and are difficult to replicate.
- **Example**: A tech company focusing on its unique software development capabilities that set it apart from competitors.
