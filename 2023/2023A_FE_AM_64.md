## Actual Definition of Business Intelligence

> [!info] Business intelligence (BI) is a set of technological processes for collecting, managing and analyzing organizational data to yield insights that inform business strategies and operations.

## Other Choices 

### b) **Computerizing daily routine works, such as decision requests, to ensure that such procedures are carried out without fail and to enable their swift completion**

- This option describes **workflow automation** or **Business Process Management (BPM)**, which involves automating routine business tasks to make sure they are completed quickly and without error.
- **BI** is focused on analyzing data for insights, while **workflow automation** focuses on improving efficiency in the execution of day-to-day tasks, such as approvals or decision-making processes.
- Example: Using a tool like **Zapier** or **Trello** to automate task approval flows.

### c) **Enabling employees to use computerized learning materials via a network and managing their learning and performance**

- This is an example of **e-learning** or **Learning Management Systems (LMS)**, not BI. It focuses on providing educational resources and tracking employee learning and performance, but it doesn’t involve analyzing business data for strategic decision-making.
- **BI** is about using data for business insights, while **LMS** is about training and employee development.
- Example: Using a platform like **Coursera** or **Moodle** to offer training and track learning outcomes.

### d) **Obtaining publications, such as annual reports issued by competitors, to understand their business strategies and financial situations**

- This is an example of **competitive intelligence** or **market research**, which involves gathering publicly available data to analyze competitors' business strategies.
- While this provides useful insights, it’s not **BI** because BI focuses on analyzing internal business data to improve decision-making within the organization, whereas **competitive intelligence** is more about understanding external factors.
- Example: Reading annual reports from competitors to compare financial performance and strategies.
