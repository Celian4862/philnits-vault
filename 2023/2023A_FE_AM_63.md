Which of the following is a scheme where the user establishes a connection to the system of a service provider via the Internet and makes online use of only the necessary functions of the applications provided by the service provider at the necessary time?

a) ERP
b) SaaS
c) SCM
d) XBRL
? 
b) SaaS

## What is SaaS?

> [!info] Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) is the business model where companies let users use software solutions hosted on their infrastructure to perform different functions tied to that service.
> - some examples include; image optimization, AI generation, audio processing, etc. services.
> 	- Google Workspace, Microsoft 365, Salesforce, Google Drive, Canvas Instructure, CodeChum

The key factor here is that we don't have to be tied to that service and pay regularly, we can simply pay for what we need at specific times that we need the software.

## Other Choices


### a) **ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning)**

- **ERP** refers to a type of software used by businesses to manage and integrate important parts of their operations, such as accounting, procurement, project management, risk management, and supply chain operations.
- Unlike **SaaS**, ERP is typically more comprehensive and is deployed either on-premises (within the company's infrastructure) or via the cloud, depending on the provider. It’s not necessarily focused on providing access only when needed, as it often involves fully integrated systems that businesses use continuously.
- Example: SAP ERP or Oracle ERP Cloud.

### c) **SCM (Supply Chain Management)**

- **SCM** refers to software or systems that help manage and optimize the flow of goods, information, and finances as a product moves from supplier to manufacturer to wholesaler to retailer to consumer.
- It’s a broader concept and can sometimes involve the use of **SaaS** applications, but it’s not specifically about renting access to software functionalities at necessary times. **SCM** is about managing entire supply chains.
- Example: Systems that help automate logistics and manage orders.

### d) **XBRL (eXtensible Business Reporting Language)**

- **XBRL** is a language for electronic communication of business and financial data. It's not a business model or software delivery method like SaaS. Instead, it's used to tag and structure financial reports so that they can be easily read by different software applications, usually for regulatory filings.
- It's used in areas like financial reporting, compliance, and auditing.
- Example: XBRL is used for creating digital financial statements that are easy to analyze.
	- they are like formulae for doing these financial functions/processes/reports.
	- they can be installed in Excel.
