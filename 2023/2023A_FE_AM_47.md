Which of the following is the most appropriate feature of polymorphism in object-oriented programming?

a) Developers are allowed to define classes incrementally by reusing classes defined 
previously as the basis for new classes. 
b) Only the information required to use a software module is published to the module user. 
c) The processes and data are combined into a single object. 
d) The same message can be interpreted differently by different classes of objects
? 
d) The same message can be interpreted differently by different classes of objects


## Definition of Polymorphism

> [!info] It is the concept of allowing children of a parent class to *redefine* or *override* properties and methods inherited from the parent.
> - this allows us to **inherit from the same parent**, but let a subclass get **assigned to references where the parent can**, but **act differently** due to the redefinition of its methods.

```Java
public static void main(String[] args) {
  Employee joe = new Employee("Average Joe");
  Employee chad = new Manager("Chad");

  joe.introduce(); // Hello, I am Average Joe, an employee!
  chad.introduce(); // Hello, I am Chad, and I manage a Local Branch.
}

public static class Employee {
  String name;
  int id;
  String department = "General";
  
  Employee(String n) {
    name = n;
  }

  void introduce() {
    System.out.println("Hello, I am " + name + ", an employee!");
  }
}

public static class Manager extends Exployee {
  String department = "Local Branch";

  Manager(String n) {
    super(n);
  }

  @Override
  void introduce() {
    System.out.println("Hello, I am " + name + ", and I manage a ", + department);
  }

}
```
