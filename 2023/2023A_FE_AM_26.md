Which of the following is an appropriate method used to remove data redundancy in relational database systems?

a) Entity-relationship
b) Functional dependency
c) Hierarchical
d) Normalization
? 
d) Normalization


> [!info] Normalization is the structuring of data in such a way that removes Data Redundancy *(information in two places at once)*.
> the normal forms from *1NF* up to *5NF* are the levels of danger to assess whether a database is normalized, *1NF* being the least optimized.
> - the most important thing to prevent is redundant data & anomalies when transactions fail.
> 	- modifying a property must not need to edit multiple rows because it may fail in the middle.

## Discussing Other Answers

a) **Entity-relationship**: A diagrammatic technique to represent entities and relationships between them in a database.

b) **Functional dependency**: A constraint that describes the relationship between attributes in a relational database.

A **functional dependency** exists when one attribute uniquely determines another attribute. For example:

- **EmployeeID → EmployeeName**: This means that each **EmployeeID** uniquely determines the corresponding **EmployeeName**. If you know the **EmployeeID**, you can always determine the **EmployeeName**.
    
- **DepartmentID → DepartmentName**: This means that for each **DepartmentID**, there is a unique **DepartmentName**. If you know the **DepartmentID**, you can uniquely determine the **DepartmentName**.

c) **Hierarchical**: A database model that organizes data in a tree-like structure, where each record has a single parent.

d) **Normalization**: A process used to structure a relational database to minimize redundancy and dependency by organizing data into related tables.
