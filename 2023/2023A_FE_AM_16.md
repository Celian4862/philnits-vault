# 2023A_FE_AM_16 %% ex. 2024S_FE-A_83 %%

Which of the following is an RAID configuration that deploys two parity records to different disk drives enabling two simultaneous disk drive failures in the same RAID group to be recovered?

a) RAID0
b) RAID1
c) RAID5
d) RAID6
? 
d) RAID6

## What is RAID?

> [!info] Redundant Array of Independent Disks
> Lets us use multiple hard disks as redundant disks in case one breaks, the other two still has a copy of the data.

### Raid Levels

> [!tip] The higher the RAID level, the more redundant the storage is & the more resilient it is to failure. It's better for data integrity, but it's slower to save data across all disks.

## Discussing the Answer

The question requires us to have **TWO disk failures**, so our only possible answer is RAID6 according to the table above.
