A power supply unit has a rated output power of 500 watts and an efficiency of 80%. In order to obtain an output power of 500 watts from this power supply unit, how many watts is the minimum input power?

a) 100
b) 400
c) 625
d) 900
? 
c) 625
## Deriving the Formula

We can define output power as `Output Power = Input Power * Efficiency`. For example, an input of `300W` with an efficiency of `50%` will output `150W`.

So in our example, let's see what's given & let's find the solution.

Given:
- output power `500W`
- efficiency `80%`

Asked: 
- input power

Solution:

1. We can derive the formula for input power by isolating it from our formula.

- `(Output Power/Efficiency) = Input Power`

2. Now we can substitute the variables into the formula
	- `(500 / .8) = input` which is also equal to $\frac{500}{\frac{4}{5}}$ and we can remove the denominator by multiplying the reciprocal to the entire equation:  $\frac{500}{\frac{4}{5}} * \frac{5}{4} = \frac{2500}{4} = 625$.

Therefore, our input power should be $625$.
