Which of the following is an appropriate CPU operation associated with cache memory?

a) When a cache hit occurs, the CPU fetches data from ROM. 
b) When a cache hit occurs, the CPU fetches data from the main memory. 
c) When a cache miss occurs, the CPU fetches data from the cache memory. 
d) When a cache miss occurs, the CPU fetches data from the main memory.
? 
d) When a cache miss occurs, the CPU fetches data from the main memory.

## Understanding the Cache (Hit & Miss)

The cache is used to store data that is frequently used. So if we frequently use an `add()` function, we store it in lower levels of cache so that it is closer to the CPU and faster to read. Reading an instruction or memory address that is in a cache is called a "Cache Hit".

A "Cache Miss" happens when we do not find it in the next higher level of cache, we look upwards to the next higher level and see if its there. Eventually, going back to the main memory, where our program code resides in.

## Understanding the Answer

In this question, we are currently working in the CPU level with CPU registers (level 0), so if we have a cache miss, this means we did not find something in the Cache Memory (level 1), so we jump another level to Main Memory (level 2).

You might have answered c) When a cache miss occurs, the CPU fetches data from the cache memory, but remember, we had a cache miss, so we must not look at the next layer, we have to go to the next one.

The other answers do not follow the proper hierarchy and immediately jump multiple levels.
