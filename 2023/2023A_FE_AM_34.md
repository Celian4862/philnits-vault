## What are Multicast IP Addresses?

A multicast address is a specific type of IP address labeling a network location that is used to **multicast data packets within a network**

It stands in contrast to other IP addresses that only allow for unicast models.

They fall under a specific range, specifically they are the **Class D IP addresses** with a range of `224.0.0.0 - 239.255.255.255`.

### What are they for?

**Multicast addresses** are used for **multicast communication**, a method of data transmission where a single packet is sent to multiple recipients or hosts that have **joined a multicast group**.

This is in contrast to **unicast**, where data is sent to a single recipient, and **broadcast**, where data is sent to all hosts in a network.

## Other Answers

- **a) 10.1.1.1**: This is a **private IPv4 address** from the **10.0.0.0/8** range used for private networks, not for multicast.
    
- **b) 192.0.2.0**: This is a **reserved IP address** from the **TEST-NET-1** range (192.0.2.0/24), used for documentation and examples, not for multicast.
    
- **c) 203.0.113.4**: This is also a **reserved IP address** from the **TEST-NET-3** range (203.0.113.0/24), used for documentation and not multicast.
