Which of the following is the most appropriate characteristic of the “big bang” or all-at-once migration method that is one of the system migration methods?

a) Additional operational costs are incurred because of parallel operations. 
b) An additional application is required for connecting the old and new systems. 
c) The old and new systems operate in parallel, and migration to the new system is 
performed at a particular point of time. 
d) The problems that occur during migration to the new system have a big impact.

d) The problems that occur during migration to the new system have a big impact. 

## What is a System Migration?

It is when you swap an entire system or a component of a system in favor of new technology or to improve cost or efficiency of that particular system or function.

This often involves huge costs & possible downtimes, so people have different strategies for managing migrations.

## The Big Bang (All-At-Once) Migration Method 

In the **big bang** approach, the entire system is migrated from the old to the new system in a single, large-scale operation at a specific point in time. This means that all data, processes, and users are transitioned simultaneously. There is no parallel operation of the old and new systems after migration — the old system is typically shut down entirely.

#### Characteristics of Big Bang Migration:

- **Immediate switch**: The transition happens all at once, meaning that when the migration is complete, users are immediately using the new system.
- **No parallel running**: Unlike other migration strategies, such as phased migration, the old system is decommissioned once the new system goes live.
- **High-risk but fast**: Since the entire system is swapped at once, any issues can cause major disruptions. However, it is quicker because there's no prolonged parallel operation.
- **Lower ongoing operational costs**: Since there is no need to run both systems at the same time, the migration itself can be cheaper in terms of operations, but only if things go smoothly.

## Other Choices 

- **a) Additional operational costs are incurred because of parallel operations**
	- This describes a phased migration where the old and new systems operate simultaneously for a time, which is not the case with the big bang approach.
	- "phase out"
    
- **b) An additional application is required for connecting the old and new systems**
	- This might apply to a **hybrid migration** where two systems need to coexist temporarily.
	- In the big bang method, there’s no need for such an application because the old system is shut down once the new one goes live.
    
- **c) The old and new systems operate in parallel, and migration to the new system is performed at a particular point of time**
	- This describes a **phased migration** or **parallel running strategy**, where both systems coexist for a time to ensure a smooth transition.
	- This is not characteristic of the big bang method, which does not have a parallel run.
