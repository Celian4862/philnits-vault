Which of the following is a computer architecture in which a processor executes the same instruction on multiple data?

a) MIMD
b) MISD
c) SIMD
d) SISD
? 
c) SIMD

This acronym literally means "Same Instruction, Multiple Data", matching what the question is asking for.
- a single instruction works on multiple data
## Understanding the Acronyms

**SIMD, MIMD, MISD, and SISD** are types of **computer architecture patterns** that describe how a computer system can process instructions and data.

These patterns were defined by **Flynn's Taxonomy**, a classification system for computer architectures based on the number of concurrent instruction and data streams they process.

### **1. SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data)**:

- **Definition**: SIMD is a parallel computing architecture where **one instruction** is applied to **multiple data** elements at the same time.
- **Example**: Useful for tasks like vector processing or graphics processing, where the same operation (e.g., adding two arrays) needs to be applied to many data points in parallel.
- **Use Case**: Often used in **multimedia applications**, like image processing or video games, where similar operations are performed on large datasets.

### **2. MIMD (Multiple Instruction, Multiple Data)**:

- **Definition**: MIMD is a parallel architecture where **multiple instructions** operate on **multiple data** streams simultaneously. Each processor works independently, executing its own instruction on its own data.
- **Example**: Used in systems with multiple processors or cores, such as multi-core CPUs, where each core can run a different program or task.
- **Use Case**: MIMD is used in **general-purpose multi-core processors** and supercomputers, where different tasks need to run concurrently.

### **3. MISD (Multiple Instruction, Single Data)**:

- **Definition**: MISD is a rare and theoretical architecture where **multiple instructions** operate on **one piece of data**. This means multiple processors work on the same data with different instructions.
- **Example**: It's not widely implemented in practice, but some fault-tolerant systems may use it for error checking by running different algorithms on the same data.
- **Use Case**: Limited real-world use; mostly found in very specialized or research-based systems.

### **4. SISD (Single Instruction, Single Data)**:

- **Definition**: SISD is a traditional, non-parallel computing architecture where **one instruction** is executed on **one piece of data** at a time.
- **Example**: Most **conventional single-core processors** operate in an SISD fashion.
- **Use Case**: Found in simple, sequential processing where parallelism is not required.
