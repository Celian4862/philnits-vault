## Mental Framework

When you think of Internet of Things (IoT), think of smart televisions, smart light switches, smart alarms, smart refrigerators, smart lights, Amazon Alexa (smart assistants), etc.

These things can be connected to the internet with their own IP addresses and they can passively collect data and analyze them for predictive analysis to improve its functions.
