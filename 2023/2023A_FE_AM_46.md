The integration test for software composed of modules arranged in a hierarchical structure is performed from a high-level module. In such a case, which of the following is a test module that is used as a substitute for a low-level module?

a) Driver
b) Emulator
c) Simulator
d) Stub
? 
d) Stub

## Definition of Terms

### a) **Driver**:

- A **test module** used to simulate a **higher-level module** that invokes the module being tested, essentially controlling or providing input to the module in question.

### b) **Emulator**:

- An **external system** or **test environment** that mimics the behavior of hardware or software components, often used to simulate the behavior of a system that is difficult to test directly.

### c) **Simulator**:

- A **software tool** that mimics the behavior of a system or environment, providing a controlled environment for testing without the need for actual hardware or systems.

### d) **Stub**:

- A **test module** that simulates the behavior of a **low-level module** by providing hardcoded responses, allowing testing of higher-level modules in a hierarchical structure without needing the actual implementation of the low-level module.
## Differences between a Stub and a Driver

|Sr.No|Stub|Driver|
|---|---|---|
|**1**|It is used for the top down integration testing.|It is used for the bottom up integration testing.|
|**2**|It is known as a called program.|It is known as the calling program.|
|**3**|It is used when the lower level modules are not available.|It is used when the higher level modules are not available.|
