## Use DeMorgan's Law

![[Pasted image 20241019133857.png]]

Our original circuit expressed in Boolean Algebra is:

$((B\cap C)' \cup A)'$

Let's simplify this.

1. $(B\cap C) \cap A'$ by DeMorgan's & Double Negation Law
	- double negation happened when we distributed the `'` to `(B ^ C)'` making it `(B ^ C)'`

As we can see, this is equivalent to answer C.
