The RFP is presented to each vendor that has responded to an RFI. Which of the following should be done beforehand to proceed fairly with the future vendor selection processes?

a) Aside from the items of an RFP, giving a high evaluation to a vendor who is familiar 
with the current system to select that vendor easily 
b) Establishing processes of selection such as setting evaluation standards or weighting 
rules of conformity to the requested items 
c) Issuing unofficial agreements to all vendors to whom the RFP has been presented and 
requesting them to prepare a contract and a statement of work to accelerate the 
conclusion of the contract after the vendor selection 
d) Preparing a bailout for a vendor who received a high evaluation on the response to the 
RFI, in case it fails in the selection
? 
b) Establishing processes of selection such as setting evaluation standards or weighting 
rules of conformity to the requested items 

## Why?

To attain fairness in selecting a vendor to buy technology or services from, we need to ensure that we are unbiased in the selection process.

In order to do that, we must lay out standards for choosing or weighing the benefits of each vendor.

The **other choices have some sort of bias imbued in their actions**.
### What is an RFI (Request for Information)?

- **RFI (Request for Information)** is a document issued by an organization to gather general information from potential vendors or suppliers.
- The purpose of an **RFI** is to:
    - Understand what products or services are available in the market.
    - Learn about the vendor’s capabilities.
    - Gather preliminary data to make informed decisions about the next steps in the vendor selection process.
- It is typically sent out at the early stage of procurement, when the organization is still exploring potential solutions and gathering ideas.

**Example:** A company looking for a cloud-based storage solution might send an RFI to cloud providers to learn about their offerings, pricing structures, and security features.

### What is an RFP (Request for Proposal)?

- **RFP (Request for Proposal)** is a more detailed document that is sent to vendors who have been shortlisted, typically after reviewing responses from the RFI.
- The purpose of an **RFP** is to:
    - Solicit detailed proposals from vendors that include pricing, timelines, solutions, and specific services that the vendor will provide.
    - Allow for a competitive bidding process, where the organization evaluates proposals and selects the best vendor based on criteria like price, functionality, and service level.
- The RFP is sent to vendors who are considered serious contenders based on the information gathered in the RFI phase.

**Example:** After gathering information from multiple cloud providers via an RFI, the company selects a few and sends them an RFP asking for a formal proposal that includes pricing details, specific features, implementation timelines, and support terms.
