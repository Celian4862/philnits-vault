created. 
b) Integration of the code and testing are continuously repeated. 
c) The code that passed the tests is not refactored until the next iteration. 
d) The customer is responsible for the specification of unit tests. 
?
b) Integration of the code and testing are continuously repeated. 


## What is Extreme Programming (XP)?

**Extreme Programming (XP)** is an agile software development methodology that emphasizes continuous integration, frequent testing, and close collaboration between developers and customers. One of the key practices in XP is **continuous integration and testing**, where developers integrate their code frequently, often several times a day, and test it continuously to ensure that everything works correctly.

- **Continuous Integration (CI)**: This practice helps identify issues early by integrating code frequently, running tests, and ensuring that the system works as a whole after each change.
- **Testing**: In XP, testing is automated and happens frequently to catch bugs early and ensure that code is always in a working state.
### What are the 12 extreme programming practices?

1. **The planning game:** XP planning is used to guide the work. The results of planning should be what you’re hoping to accomplish and by when, and what you’ll do next.
    
2. **Customer tests:** When you finish a new feature, the customer will develop an acceptance test to determine how close it is to their original user story.
    
3. **Small releases:** XP uses small, routine releases to gain insights throughout the process. Often, releases go straight to the customers, though they can happen in-house.
    
4. **Simple design:** The XP system is designed for simplicity—you’ll produce only what is necessary and nothing more. 
    
5. **Pair programming:** All programming comes from a pair of developers who sit side by side. There is no solo work in extreme programming.
    
6. **Test-driven development (TDD):** XP’s reliance on feedback requires heavy testing. Through short cycles, programmers release automated tests and then immediately react.
    
7. **Refactoring:** This is where you’ll pay attention to the finer details of the codebase, removing duplicates and making sure that the code is cohesive. This results in good, simple designs.
    
8. **Collective ownership:** Any coding pair can change the code at any time, whether or not they developed it. XP produces code as a team, and everyone’s work is held to the higher collective standards.
    
9. **Continuous integration:** XP teams don’t wait for completed iterations, they integrate constantly. Often, an XP team will integrate multiple times a day.
    
10. **Sustainable pace:** The intensity of XP works requires you to set a sustainable pace. Teams should decide how much work they can produce in this way per day and per week, and use that to set work deadlines.
    
11. **Metaphor:** The metaphor is, quite literally, a metaphor. It’s decided as a team, and uses language to describe how the team should function. For example, we’re ants working as a collective to build up the anthill. 
    
12. **Coding standard:** XP teams follow one standard. In the same way that writers need to take on a brand’s voice to sound like the same person is always writing, XP developers code in the same, unified way so that it reads like one developer.

### Why the Other Choices are Incorrect:

**a) After the code is created, and it is confirmed that it can be integrated, test cases are created.**

- This is not aligned with XP practices. In XP, **tests** are written **before** the code is created (this is known as **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**). Writing test cases after the code is created goes against the principle of ensuring that the code is written to pass tests from the outset.

**c) The code that passed the tests is not refactored until the next iteration.**

- This is incorrect because in XP, **refactoring** is done continuously throughout the development process. Once the code passes the tests, it's often refactored immediately to improve its structure while maintaining functionality. XP encourages **continuous refactoring** to keep the code clean and maintainable, not just waiting for the next iteration.

**d) The customer is responsible for the specification of unit tests.**

- In XP, **customers** provide user stories or requirements, but they are **not responsible for writing unit tests**. **Developers** are responsible for writing unit tests as part of the TDD approach. The customer may help define acceptance criteria, but unit tests are a developer's responsibility.
