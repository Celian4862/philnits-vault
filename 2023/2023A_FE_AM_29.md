Which of the following is a file in which values before and after an update of the database are written and saved as the update history of the database?

a) Backup file
b) Checkpoint file
c) Dump file
d) Log file
? 
d) Log file

## Summary of Choices 

### a) Backup file

A backup file is a copy of the database or a subset of its data that is stored separately to **prevent data loss in case of failure, corruption, or accidental deletion**. Backups can be full (containing the entire database) or incremental (containing only changes made since the last backup).

### b) Checkpoint file

A checkpoint file is a **point-in-time snapshot of the database state, created during the database's operation**. It saves the current state of the database to minimize the amount of data that needs to be recovered after a crash, ensuring that only changes made after the checkpoint need to be processed.
- used to rollback crashes

### c) Dump file

A dump file is a **complete export of the database's contents**, usually in a format suitable for storage or transfer. This can be used to create a backup, migrate data to another database, or analyze the database structure and data.

### d) Log file

A log file **records all changes made to the database, including before and after values of updates**, which provides a history of operations. It is critical for data recovery, allowing the database to be restored to a consistent state in case of a crash or failure.
- used to rollback data mutations or transactions
- it contains data like the type of operation & the values
