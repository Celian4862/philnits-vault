### Explanation

The correct answer is **c) GROUP BY Class, Subject ORDER BY Class, Subject** because it fits the logical structure and intent of the SQL query.

- The SQL query intends to calculate the average score for each **Class** and **Subject** combination. To do this, you need to group the data by these two fields.
- After calculating the averages, the result should be ordered by **Class** and **Subject**, as specified in the query prompt.

### Why the Others Won't Fit

**a) GROUP BY Class, AverageScore ORDER BY Class, Subject**:

- This is incorrect because **AverageScore** is an alias for the aggregated result (`AVG(Score)`), not a column in the original table. You cannot group by a calculated aggregate like **AverageScore**. SQL requires grouping by fields that are not aggregate functions (such as **Class** and **Subject**).

**b) GROUP BY Class, Subject ORDER BY Class, AVG(Score)**:

- Although the grouping part is correct, the **ORDER BY AVG(Score)** is problematic. You cannot order by an aggregate function in this context, since the prompt asks for ordering by **Class** and **Subject** (not by the average score). Ordering by **Class** and **Subject** is more logical when sorting the data.

**d) GROUP BY Class, Subject, StudentNumber ORDER BY Class, Subject, AverageScore**:

- This is incorrect because adding **StudentNumber** in the **GROUP BY** clause would break the purpose of averaging scores by **Class** and **Subject**. By grouping by **StudentNumber**, you would create a group for each student, effectively preventing the `AVG(Score)` from being calculated per **Class** and **Subject**.
- Additionally, the **ORDER BY AverageScore** is not what the prompt asks forâ€”it requires ordering by **Class** and **Subject**.
