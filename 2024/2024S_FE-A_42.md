### What is a Cost Performance Index (CPI)
When doing projects, it costs money. So you'll need to budget your finds wisely.
CPI helps track how much this thing costs, or that thing costs and increases the over all chance for a project to be completed within budget.

**Formula for Earned Value = Percent of Work Complete x Project Budget**
**Formula for CPI = Earned Value / Actual Cost**

**Earned Value** is basically how much work you've done based on the total project duration.

So far, 1 month has passed by and the duration of the project is 4 months, so we're 25% complete.
Put that in the **Earned Value** formula and we'll get 25,000.

Now we can get the CPI, so input those numbers in the formula and we'll get 1.25.
