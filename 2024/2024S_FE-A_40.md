Which of the following is the appropriate order of the six phases in the SDLC (Software Development Life Cycle) model?
a) Requirements Analysis -> Design -> Programming -> Deployment -> Testing -> Maintenance
b) Requirements Analysis -> Design -> Programming -> Testing -> Deployment -> Maintenance
c) Requirements Analysis -> Design -> Programming -> Testing -> Maintenance -> Deployment
d) Requirements Analysis -> Programming -> Testing -> Design -> Maintenance -> Deployment
? 
b) Requirements Analysis -> Design -> Programming -> Testing -> Deployment -> Maintenance

### What is this SDLC Model?
Very self explanatory, it's how a software gets developed and what processes you'll do along the way.

1.) you'll need the requirements
2.) Then, you'll need the outline of the software, not program right away, so **d.** is out of the question
3.) Once you have the design (Figma) you can now program yay.
4.) After that you don't deploy. Big no no, you'll have to test it first.
5.) Once everything passes, you can deploy it.
6.) After deploying, you'll just have to maintain it and keep on a look out for future issues.
