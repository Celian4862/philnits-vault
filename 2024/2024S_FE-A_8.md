Q8. There are two microprocessors: a 32-bit CPU capable of executing each of 32-bit, 16-bit, and 8-bit long instructions in 1 cycle, and a 16-bit CPU capable of executing each of 16-bit and 8-bit long instructions in 1 cycle. Additionally, the 16-bit CPU can execute a 32-bit long instruction in 2 cycles. When the appearance ratio of 32-bit long instructions is 40%, of 16-bit long instructions is 40%, and of 8-bit long instructions is 20% respectively, what is the percentage improvement in total execution time with the 32-bit CPU compared to the 16-bit CPU? Here, both the 32-bit and 16-bit CPU operate at the same clock speed and have the same performance except for the executable instruction length in 1 cycle.
a) 28.57 
b) 40 
c) 50 
d) 71.43
? 
a) 28.57 
### Step 1: Calculate for Total Execution Times

- **32-bit CPU Execution Times**:
    - **32-bit instructions**: 1 cycle (40% of total instructions)
    - **16-bit instructions**: 1 cycle (40% of total instructions)
    - **8-bit instructions**: 1 cycle (20% of total instructions)
    
    **Total Execution Time for 32-bit CPU:**
	    **$T_{32}=(0.4 \times 1) + (0.4 \times 1) + (0.2 \times 1)=1 cycle$**
	    
- **32-bit CPU Execution Times**:
    - **32-bit instructions**: 2 cycles (since it takes 2 cycles to execute a 32-bit instruction)
    - **16-bit instructions**: 1 cycle (40% of total instructions)
    - **8-bit instructions**: 1 cycle (20% of total instructions)
    
    **Total Execution Time for 16-bit CPU**: 
	    **$T_{32}=(0.4 \times 2) + (0.4 \times 1) + (0.2 \times 1)=1.4 cycles$

### Step 2: Calculate for Percentage Improvement

Percentage Improvement = $\dfrac{(T_{16} - T_{32})}{T_{16}}\times 100$

Percentage Improvement = $\dfrac{(1.40 - 1.00)}{1.40}\times 100$

Percentage Improvement = 28.57%
