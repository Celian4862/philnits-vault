Which of the following is a critical step in creating a relational database?

a) Building a network diagram 
b) Creating entity-relationship diagrams 
c) Designing a flowchart 
d) Programming in C++
? 
b) Creating entity-relationship diagrams 
### Step 1: Explanation

1. A network diagram would be useful if you were creating a complex network for homes or other industrial buildings. It is out of scope when talking about the creation of a relational database
    
2. Creating entity-relationship diagrams are essential before making a relational database because they define the relationships between entities (tables) in your database. By having a clear visual representation of these relationships, creating the relational database becomes easier.
    
3. Designing a flowchart is used to document, study and plan complex processes in clear diagrams in order to identify your methodology in solving it. It is not involved in the process of creating a relational database.
    
4. Programming in C++ is not necessarily involved in the process of creating a relational database, though there are ways that it can be used in creating one. It is not critical to the process.
