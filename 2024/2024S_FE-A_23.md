Which of the following is the network device that makes a forwarding decision on the basis of the destination MAC address in the frame header?
a) Patch cable 
b) Repeater hub 
c) Router 
d) Switching hub
? 
d) Switching hub
### Explanation

A **switching hub** (commonly referred to as a **switch**) is a network device that operates at the **data link layer** (Layer 2) of the OSI model. It makes forwarding decisions based on the **destination MAC address** contained in the frame header. When a frame arrives at the switch, the switch examines the MAC address of the destination device and forwards the frame only to the specific port associated with that address, reducing network congestion and improving performance.

### Why the Others Won't Fit

**a) Patch cable**:

- A **patch cable** is simply a physical medium, typically a twisted pair or fiber optic cable, used to connect devices to a switch, hub, router, or other network components. It does not make any forwarding decisions or interact with MAC addresses. Thus, this is not a network device.

**b) Repeater hub**:

- A **repeater hub** operates at the **physical layer** (Layer 1) of the OSI model. It does not examine or use MAC addresses. Instead, it broadcasts incoming data to all ports without distinguishing between devices, which results in higher network traffic and collisions. Since it does not make forwarding decisions based on the MAC address, this option is incorrect.

**c) Router**:

- A **router** operates at the **network layer** (Layer 3) of the OSI model and makes forwarding decisions based on **IP addresses**, not MAC addresses. It routes packets between different networks by examining the destination IP address. While routers play a key role in networking, they do not make forwarding decisions based on MAC addresses, so this option is incorrect.
