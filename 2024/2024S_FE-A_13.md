An operating system adopts the priority scheduling algorithm for scheduling processes. There are five processes A, B, C, D and E arriving at the same time with estimated running times of 10, 6, 2, 4, and 8 milliseconds, respectively. Their priorities are 3, 5, 2, 1, and 4, where 1 is the highest priority. What is the mean process turnaround time?
a) 14
b) 16 
c) 20 
d) 22
? 
b) 16 
### Step 1: Determine what is being asked for

"What is the mean process turnaround time?"

This denotes that the answer is being measured in time.

It is different from preemptive SRTF scheduling. It utilizes the priority scheduling algorithm.

Â Turnaround time is the time the process completes its execution - the arrival time. (Completion time - Arrival Time)

### Step 2: Calculate for the Turnaround times per process

It is given that the arrival time is consistent all throughout the processes. This means that turnaround time can be calculated using the completion time alone (turnaround time of the previous process) + run time of the current process.

| Process | Running time (Burst Time) | Priority | Turn Around time |
| ------- | ------------------------- | -------- | ---------------- |
| A       | 10                        | 3        | 6+10 = 16        |
| B       | 6                         | 5        | 24 + 6 = 30      |
| C       | 2                         | 2        | 4+2 = 6          |
| D       | 4                         | 1        | 0+4 = 4          |
| E       | 8                         | 4        | 16 + 8 = 24      |

Once we sum up all of the turnaround times, we are left with 80.

To get the mean turnaround time, it would be $\dfrac{80}{5}$ = 16ms
