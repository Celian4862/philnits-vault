Which of the following describes a brute force attack aimed at finding the key of symmetric encryption?

a) Finding the key by observing the ciphertext change when the plaintext is altered by a certain amount 
b) Finding the key by testing all key combinations sequentially when a set of plaintext and ciphertext is given
c) Finding the key by using the algebraic expression representing the relationship between the plaintext, ciphertext, and key as a clue 
d) Finding the key by using the statistical correlation between a part of the information of the plaintext and part of the information of the ciphertext as a clue
? 
b) Finding the key by testing all key combinations sequentially when a set of plaintext and ciphertext is given
### Explanation

A **brute force attack** is a method used to find the key in a cryptographic system by **systematically testing all possible key combinations** until the correct one is found. This approach doesnâ€™t rely on any weaknesses in the encryption algorithm; instead, it relies on the sheer computational power to try every possible key. In symmetric encryption, where the same key is used for both encryption and decryption, a brute force attack will eventually succeed if enough time and resources are available to test all key combinations.

### Why the Others Won't Fit

**a) Finding the key by observing the ciphertext change when the plaintext is altered by a certain amount**:

- This describes an **attack based on differential cryptanalysis**, not a brute force attack. In differential cryptanalysis, the attacker looks at how differences in the plaintext lead to differences in the ciphertext to deduce the key.

**c) Finding the key by using the algebraic expression representing the relationship between the plaintext, ciphertext, and key as a clue**:

- This describes a form of **algebraic cryptanalysis** or possibly **linear cryptanalysis**, where the attacker tries to exploit mathematical properties of the encryption algorithm. This is not brute force because it relies on algebraic structures rather than testing every key.

**d) Finding the key by using the statistical correlation between a part of the information of the plaintext and part of the information of the ciphertext as a clue**:

- This describes **statistical cryptanalysis**, such as linear cryptanalysis or frequency analysis, where an attacker tries to exploit patterns or correlations between plaintext and ciphertext. It is more sophisticated than brute force and doesn't involve testing every key combination.
