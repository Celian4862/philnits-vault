Which of the following can change the deadlock state of the transaction back to the normal state?
a) Commit 
b) Drop 
c) Rollback 
d) Roll Forward
? 
c) Rollback 
### Explanation

A **deadlock** occurs when two or more transactions are waiting for each other to release resources, and none of them can proceed. To resolve a deadlock, the system must break the cycle of waiting by aborting one or more transactions involved in the deadlock.

- **Rollback** refers to aborting a transaction and undoing any changes it has made. When a transaction involved in a deadlock is rolled back, it releases the resources it was holding, allowing the other transactions to proceed. This effectively resolves the deadlock and returns the system to a normal state.

### Why the Others Won't Fit

**a) Commit**:

- A **commit** finalizes all changes made by a transaction and permanently saves them to the database. However, in the case of a deadlock, committing is not possible because the transaction is waiting for a resource held by another transaction. Thus, **commit** cannot resolve a deadlock.

**b) Drop**:

- **Drop** is a command that removes a database object (like a table, index, or view) entirely. It is unrelated to resolving a deadlock situation in transactions. Dropping an object wonâ€™t free up resources involved in the deadlock, so this option is incorrect.

**d) Roll Forward**:

- **Roll Forward** is typically used during recovery after a failure, where committed transactions are applied to the database to bring it to a consistent state. This does not resolve a deadlock because it is related to restoring the database state after a crash, not resolving transactional conflicts.
