Which of the following is a case that enables the customer support operations at a call
center to improve quality by applying a pattern recognition function or machine learning
function to the accumulated data?
a) Deriving the most appropriate response in real time from related materials and all the
previous support history according to the content of the inquiry made by a customer
b) Displaying the digital content of a response manual or basic customer information on a
pop-up window of a screen for responding to requests from the operators
c) Repeatedly providing role play training to new operators from an experienced operator
who serves as a lecturer by using the response manual as the teaching material
d) Transferring a phone call or the relevant support screen to an experienced operator or a
dedicated staff when the operator who is responding to a customer over the phone is
unable to provide an answer
? 
c) 291.25
### Step 1: Convert the whole part (123) to decimal.

The hexadecimal number `123` can be expanded as:

$1 \times 16^2 + 2 \times 16^1 + 3 \times 16^0$

$= 1 \times 256 + 2 \times 16 + 3 \times 1$

$= 256 + 32 + 3 = 291$

### Step 2: Convert the fractional part (0.4) to decimal.

In hexadecimal, `4` means \( 4 \times 16^{-1} \):

$4 \times \frac{1}{16} = \frac{4}{16} = 0.25$

### Step 3: Add the whole and fractional parts together.

$291 + 0.25 = 291.25$
