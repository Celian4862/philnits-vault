The activities and milestones of a project are shown in the arrow diagram below. Which of the following is an appropriate description of the project if the duration of activity B is increased by 5 days?
![[Pasted image 20241018212653.png]]
a) The earliest start time of activity G is delayed by 5 days. 
b) The latest start time of activity F is delayed by 5 days. 
c) The project’s minimum completion time does not change. 
d) The project’s minimum completion time is increased by 5 days.
? 
c) The project’s minimum completion time does not change. 
### Identify Paths
**First Path:** A -> B -> F -> H
**Second Path:** C -> D -> G -> H
**Third Path:** A -> B -> E -> G -> H

### Add All the Days
**First Path:** 10 + 5 + 20 + 15 = 50 days
**Second Path:** 10 + 25 + 15 + 15 = 65 days
**Third Path:** 10 + 5 + 10 + 15 + 15 = 55 days

### Add +5 days to Activity B
**First Path:** 10 + 10 + 20 + 15 = 55 days
**Second Path:** 10 + 25 + 15 + 15 = 65 days
**Third Path:** 10 + 10 + 10 + 15 + 15 = 60 days

So, what can we conclude from this?
Both the 1st and 3rd path increased by 5 days, but the 2nd path remained the same.
No matter how short the other path are, the 2nd path will always be the minimum completion time since it's the longest.

Just like in a group work, if you finished your part, but your other group members didn't do it yet, the project is still ongoing. The project will only be finished once everyone finished their parts.
