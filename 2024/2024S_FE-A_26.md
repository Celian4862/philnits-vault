Which of the following is the network utility that is used to check detailed TCP connection information of the host?
a) arp 
b) ipconfig 
c) netstat 
d) ping
? 
c) netstat 
### Explanation

**Netstat (network statistics)** is a command-line network utility used to display detailed information about **TCP** (and other protocol) connections on the host machine. It provides information such as:

- Active **TCP** and **UDP** connections.
- Listening ports.
- Routing tables.
- Network interface statistics.

Netstat is particularly useful for troubleshooting network issues and checking the status of connections, including which ports are being used and which connections are established or waiting.

### Why the Others Won't Fit

**a) arp (Address Resolution Protocol)**:

- The **arp** command is used to view and manage the **ARP table**, which maps IP addresses to MAC addresses. It is not used to check TCP connection information.

**b) ipconfig**:

- **ipconfig** is a utility that displays network interface configurations on Windows systems, such as IP addresses, subnet masks, and default gateways. It does not provide information about TCP connections.

**d) ping**:

- **Ping** is used to test the reachability of a host on an IP network. It sends ICMP echo request packets and measures the time it takes to receive a reply, but it does not provide information about TCP connections
