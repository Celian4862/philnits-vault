When a company wants to earn a profit of $42,000, which of following is the number
of units that the company must sell under the conditions shown in the table below?
![[Pasted image 20241021165541.png]]
a) 14,000 
b) 18,200 
c) 26,000 
d) 26,200
? 
b) 18,200 

### Solve
Price per unit = $17

Find the Total Fixed costs so just add them all up
$130,000 + $10,000 = $140,000

Find the Total Variable costs
3 + 4 = 7 dollars/unit

The goal is $42,000

So let's calculate the needed units:
(Fixed Costs + Target Profit) / (Selling Price per Unit - Variable Costs per Unit)

(140000 + 42000) / (17 - 7) = 18,200 units
