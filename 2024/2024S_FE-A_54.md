A factory manufactures the three products that are shown in the table below. Which of
the following is the maximum possible profit in dollars? Here, there is an upper limit to the
monthly demand volume for each product. Also, the factory can only use up to 200 hours
per month for the manufacturing process and cannot manufacture more than one products
in parallel.

a) 26,250 
b) 30,000 
c) 31,500 
d) 33,000

d) 33,000

### First find how much units can you produce per hour
For Product X, you can produce 1 unit per 6 minutes. That's 10 units per hour.
60 minutes / 6 minutes = 10 units

For Product Y, 1 unit per 10 minutes.
60 minutes / 10 minutes = 6 units

For Product Z, 1 unit per 15 minutes.
60 minutes / 15 minutes = 4 units.

Once you know how many units you'll get per hour, let's turn that into profits.
### Finding the profits per hour
This is simple, just multiply the units by the profit per unit in the table
Product X:
10 units x $18 = $180/hour

Product Y:
6 units x $25 = $150/hour

Product Z:
4 units x $30 = $120/hour

### Finding maximum production in 1 month
Once your done finding the profits in 1 hour, you'll need to find the maximum amount of time you can use the factory in 1 month.

200 hours per month sounds so little, but I guess that's what they only allow.

24 hours = 1 day
48 hours = 2 days

soo, multiply the 200 hours by 24 to get the equivalent in days.

200 hours x 24 hours = 8.333333 days or 25/3 days

### Find the profits for each product
Now we can find the maximum profit for 8.33333 days (25/3).

Going back to the profits per hour, we can see the Product X has the highest profits per hour, so let's use that first

Product X:  10 units/hour   |   $180/hour
Product Y:    6 units/hour   |   $150/hour
Product Z:    4 units/hour   |   $120/hour

Remember we also have a limit of only 1000 units.

If we only use Product X for the entire 8.3333 days (25/3), we'll product more units than what is given in the table.

10 units x 24 hours x 25/3 days = 2000 units.

For Product X, we can only have 1000, so we'll divide 25/3 days in half (25/6 days), so we can only produce 1000 units.

Now calculate the profits for Product X
$180 x 24 hours x 25/6 days = $18,000

---
We've reached our quota for Product X, but that only took half of the needed time, we have 4.1666666 days remaining or 25/6 days.

Looking at the profits per hour chart, Product Y gives the second best results, so let's use that.

If we calculate whether 6 units/hour will go beyond 900 units in 25/6 days, let's calculate first.

6 units x 24 hours x 25/6 days = 600 units

Nice, 600 units is less than 900 units, so we can allocate the entire factory with just Product Y, and not needing to touch Product Z.

Now calculate the profits for Product Y
$150 x 24 hours x 25/6 days = $15,000

### Combine the results
Product X = $18,000
Product Y = $15,000
Total Profits = $33,000
