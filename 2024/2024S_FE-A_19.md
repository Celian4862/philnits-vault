### Explanation

The diagram shows three entities: **Department**, **Employee**, and **Dependent**.

There is an arrow from **Department** to **Employee**, which suggests a relationship between departments and employees, typically indicating that each department can have multiple employees.

The arrow from **Employee** to **Dependent** suggests that an employee can have multiple dependents.

**Option A** correctly interprets the E-R model by stating that a department can have many employees, and employees can have multiple dependents, which aligns with the structure shown in the diagram.

The other options do not fully capture these relationships:

- **b)** suggests each employee has exactly one dependent, which is incorrect based on the diagram's "many" relationship.
- **c)** incorrectly limits employees to at most one dependent.
- **d)** does not relate to the diagram, as it introduces a relationship where an employee can work in two departments, which is not shown in the model.
