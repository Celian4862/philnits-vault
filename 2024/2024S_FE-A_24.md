# 2024S_FE-A_24 %% ex. 2024S_FE-A_83 %%

Which of the following is the broadcast address of the network 192.168.10.0/23?
a) 192.168.10.0 
b) 192.168.10.255
c) 192.168.10.511 
d) 192.168.11.255
? 
d) 192.168.11.255
### Explanation

The IP address **192.168.10.0/23** uses a **/23** subnet mask, which means the subnet mask is **255.255.254.0**. This gives the network a range that spans **2 consecutive Class C subnets** (a total of 512 IP addresses). A /23 subnet has **9 host bits**, which allows for 512 IP addresses (2^9 = 512), including network and broadcast addresses.

Calculating the range:

- **192.168.10.0/23** starts at **192.168.10.0** (the network address).
- The last address in this range is the **broadcast address**. Since a /23 subnet spans 512 addresses, the network range includes addresses from **192.168.10.0** to **192.168.11.255**.

 Breakdown of the addresses:

- The **network address** (first address in the range) is **192.168.10.0**.
- The **last usable address** (the broadcast address) in this range is **192.168.11.255**, which is used to broadcast to all hosts within the network.

### Why the Others Won't Fit

- **a) 192.168.10.0**: This is the **network address**, not the broadcast address. It identifies the network itself and cannot be used as a broadcast address.
- **b) 192.168.10.255**: This would be the broadcast address for a **/24** subnet (with subnet mask 255.255.255.0), but since we are dealing with a **/23** subnet, the broadcast address covers both 192.168.10.x and 192.168.11.x, making **192.168.11.255** the broadcast address.
- **c) 192.168.10.511**: This is not a valid address because the maximum possible address in this range would be **192.168.11.255**.
