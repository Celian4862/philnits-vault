d) L ≧ ( S − R ) × T
### Step 1: Explanation

Buffer - Temporary storage for data that is being transferred from one place to another.

 L (buffer size) should not undergo buffer overflow, thus L should be greater than or equal to the amount of data in the buffer
- From this we get L>=, reducing our options to two
	- The sending task has a HIGHER transfer speed than the receiving task.
	- Since data is being transferred faster, the receiving task cannot keep up.
	- The data that cannot yet be processed is stored in the buffer 
	- Thus we get (S-R) because the accumulated data in the buffer is the difference between the SENDING TASK and the RECEIVING TASK.
	- Multiply by T to show the amount of data accumulated in the buffer over time.
