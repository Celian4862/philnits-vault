Which of the following is an appropriate explanation of the technology S curve?
a) It represents the diffusion process of a new technology. It shows that the growth rate of
the penetration rate gradually decreases as products applying the technology penetrate
the market, by using a frequency distribution curve.
b) It represents the maturing process of technology. It shows that during the time until the
new technology is actually spread, the degree of awareness changes as time passes.
c) It represents the process of technological progress. It shows that technology advances
slowly at the beginning, then advances rapidly, and thereafter, slowly stagnates.
d) It represents the relationship between production volume and unit cost. It shows the
course of reduction in unit cost with an increase in cumulative production volume.
? 
c) It represents the process of technological progress. It shows that technology advances
slowly at the beginning, then advances rapidly, and thereafter, slowly stagnates.
### Technology S Curve
Just like anything in life, over time you'll see some kind of increase.

If you invest in the stock market (S&P500) average returns are typically increasing over the years (excluding the market crashes).

Compound interest starts slow then all of a sudden after a long time it sky rockets. Like if you were to invest in a ROTH IRA, by 60 years old you'll be able to get millions from just depositing a few hundreds/thousands on your 20s.

It the line also looks like some kind of letter C that's lying down.

The graph below is like the letter S, which is why it's called the **Technology S Curve**

At first, it's just like compound interest. Building your technology is slow, and hard, but as time goes on it gets easier and you'll start to see massive progress.

After a while, once your technology is now developed and has matured, it will reach a stabilization point and slow back down.
