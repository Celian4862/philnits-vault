In the process of creating animation, which of the following is used to record the natural movement of objects, humans, and animals by using sensors and video cameras?
a) Key frame method
b) Morphing 
c) Motion capture
d) Pixel shader
? 
c) Motion capture
### Explanation

Motion capture (often abbreviated as "mocap") is a technique used in animation and visual effects to record the natural movement of objects, humans, and animals. It involves placing sensors on the subject's body, which capture the movement in real-time. These movements are then used to animate digital characters or objects. Video cameras and sensors are integral to the motion capture process, translating physical actions into digital animations.

### Why the Others Won't Fit

**a) Key frame method:**  
In the key frame method, animators define crucial points of an object's or character's movement (called keyframes), and the software interpolates the frames between these points to create smooth motion. This technique is widely used in traditional and digital animation, but it does not involve recording real-world movements using sensors or cameras. Instead, it relies on manually defining positions and transitions over time.

**b) Morphing:**  
Morphing is a technique used to transform one image or shape into another, typically by blending them together over time. It’s commonly seen in visual effects where one object gradually changes into another. Morphing doesn’t involve capturing real-world motion; rather, it’s a digital manipulation of shapes and images.

**d) Pixel shader:**  
A pixel shader is a graphics programming tool used to manipulate the appearance of pixels in 3D rendering. It's primarily concerned with how an image or texture appears on the screen, such as adding lighting effects or textures. Pixel shaders deal with visual effects at the pixel level rather than motion or movement and do not involve recording or replicating physical movements.
