There is a program module that is executed only when the integer value of integer x is
25 ≤ 𝑥 < 50. When testing this module using boundary value analysis, which of the
following is an appropriate combination of values to be tested?
a) 24, 25, 49, 50
b) 24, 25, 50, 51
c) 25, 26, 49, 50
d) 25, 26, 50, 51
?
a) 24, 25, 49, 50
### What is Boundary Value Analysis?

It's like testing for edge cases where the system might become broken.
This kind of testing is seeing if the value goes out of bounds or not.

From the example, the range is **25 to 49**.

Anything inside the range is valid.
26 is valid.
27 is valid.
36 is valid.
47 is valid.

Anything outside is invalid
24 is invalid.
99 is invalid.


### Why is b not the answer?

**b) 24, 25, 50, 51**

- Starting with 24, it's invalid.
- 25 is valid, so we have our starting range.
- 50 is invalid, soooo where does our range end? We don't know. It could be 49, 48, 34? Who knows?

Similar to other options, we lack information to make our range, so the answer is
**a.) 24, 25, 49, 50**
