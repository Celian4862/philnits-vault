Which of the following is an explanation of the reverse engineering of software?
a) The entire software is reconstructed after the existing software is analyzed and understood. 
b) The existing software is analyzed, and its specification and structure are clarified. 
c) The internal structure of the software is changed without any change to the externally observed behavior. 
d) The source code is automatically generated from the design information by a development support tool.
? 
b) The existing software is analyzed, and its specification and structure are clarified. 
### Step 1: Convert the whole part (123) to decimal.

The hexadecimal number `123` can be expanded as:

$1 \times 16^2 + 2 \times 16^1 + 3 \times 16^0$

$= 1 \times 256 + 2 \times 16 + 3 \times 1$

$= 256 + 32 + 3 = 291$

### Step 2: Convert the fractional part (0.4) to decimal.

In hexadecimal, `4` means \( 4 \times 16^{-1} \):

$4 \times \frac{1}{16} = \frac{4}{16} = 0.25$

### Step 3: Add the whole and fractional parts together.

$291 + 0.25 = 291.25$
