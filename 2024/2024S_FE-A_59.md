defined as a linear equation, which of the following is the appropriate numerical value to be
inserted into blank A below?

a) 30,000 
b) 35,000 
c) 40,000 
d) 45,000
? 
d) 45,000
### Draw it out
To make your life easier just draw it out
$30 = 0
$10 = 60,000 units

you can find the middle point which is $20, and also finding the mid point of the units. Mid point of 0 and 60,000 is 30,000

$30 = 0
$20 = 30,000 units
$10 = 60,000 units

You can do the same for $20 and $10, finding the mid points. $15 is the mid point between $20 and $10.

The mid point between 30,000 and 60,000 is 45,000
so you now have this.

$30 = 0
$20 = 30,000 units
***$15 = 45,000 units***
$10 = 60,000 units
