### Explanation

Since the fields of Price and SpecialPrice are already given, what needs to be determined are the remaining fields that can be inferred from the ERD.

From the figure, we can see that there is an optional many relationship between Catalog and CatalogProduct and between ProductItem and CatalogProduct. In a relational database, the practice for defining a relationship between tables is through a foreign key, which can be mapped to the adjacent table.

See [SQL FOREIGN KEY](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_ref_foreign_key.asp) for more information.

With this information, we can deduce that the CatalogProduct table should have the fields of CatalogID and ProductID as these can be mapped to the primary keys of the ProductItem and Catalog tables. These serve as the foreign keys in the CatalogProduct table that can be used to form a relationship with the adjacent tables.
