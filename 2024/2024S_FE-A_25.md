Which of the following is the name of a communication standard that is used in mobile phone networks and has the three characteristics described below?

(1) All communications are processed with a packet switching scheme.
(2) It is possible to use a communication scheme called MIMO that uses multiple antennas. 
(3) It has been standardized in the international standardization project 3GPP (3rd Generation Partnership Project).

a) LTE (Long Term Evolution)
b) MAC (Media Access Control) 
c) MDM (Mobile Device Management) 
d) VoIP (Voice over Internet Protocol)
? 
a) LTE (Long Term Evolution)
### Explanation

**LTE (Long Term Evolution)** is a communication standard used in mobile phone networks that meets all three of the characteristics described:

1. **Packet switching scheme**: LTE uses packet-switched communication for data transfer, which is different from older circuit-switched networks used for voice calls. This allows for more efficient use of network resources, especially for data transmission.
    
2. **MIMO (Multiple Input Multiple Output)**: LTE supports **MIMO**, a technology that uses multiple antennas at both the transmitter and receiver to improve communication performance. MIMO enhances data throughput and signal reliability, which is a key feature in LTE networks.
    
3. **Standardized by 3GPP**: LTE has been standardized by the **3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP)**, which is a global collaboration between telecommunications organizations that work on mobile telecommunication standards like LTE and 5G.

### Why the Others Won't Fit

**b) MAC (Media Access Control)**:

- **Media Access Control (MAC)** is a protocol used to control how devices access and transmit data over a network, typically in wired or wireless LANs. It is not specific to mobile networks and does not meet the criteria of being a mobile communication standard that supports MIMO or packet switching in mobile networks.

**c) MDM (Mobile Device Management)**:

- **Mobile Device Management (MDM)** refers to software solutions used by organizations to manage and secure mobile devices like smartphones and tablets. It has nothing to do with mobile network communication standards and does not involve packet switching or MIMO technology.

**d) VoIP (Voice over Internet Protocol)**:

- **VoIP** is a technology used to deliver voice communications over IP networks (like the internet), but it is not a mobile network communication standard. While VoIP uses packet switching for voice data, it is not standardized by 3GPP, nor does it typically support MIMO technology.
