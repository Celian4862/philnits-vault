Q10. Which of the following is the port that can theoretically connect up to 127 peripheral devices, controlled by a PC?
a) Displayport 
b) HDMI 
c) SATA 
d) USB
? 
d) USB
### Explanation:
- **USB (Universal Serial Bus)**: USB can connect multiple devices using a single port. Specifically, USB supports a topology where one USB host can manage up to 127 devices through the use of hubs. Each hub can connect multiple devices, effectively expanding the number of peripherals that can be connected to a single USB port.
### Why the Others Don't Fit:

- **DisplayPort**: Primarily used for video and audio output, it does not support connecting a large number of peripheral devices in the same way USB does.
    
- **HDMI (High-Definition Multimedia Interface)**: Mainly used for transmitting video and audio from a source (like a PC) to a display (like a monitor or TV), and it does not connect multiple peripheral devices.
    
- **SATA (Serial Advanced Technology Attachment)**: Used primarily for connecting storage devices such as hard drives and SSDs. It does not support multiple devices in the way that USB does.
