In an OS where permissions for reading, writing, or executing a file can be
independently set as attributes of the file, one bit is allocated for each of these three (3)
permissions to determine whether they are allowed or not. When these three bits are
configured using an octal value from 0 through 7, the trial results below are obtained.
Which of the following is an appropriate trial result?

[Trial results]
(1) When 0 is set, reading, writing, and execution can no longer be performed.
(2) When 3 is set, reading and writing can be performed, but execution cannot.
(3) When 7 is set, reading, writing, and execution can be performed.

a) When 2 is set, reading and execution can be performed.
b) When 4 is set, only execution can be performed.
c) When 5 is set, only writing can be performed.
d) When 6 is set, reading and writing can be performed.
? 
c) When 4 is set, only execution can be performed.
### Step 1: Convert the whole part (123) to decimal.

The hexadecimal number `123` can be expanded as:

$1 \times 16^2 + 2 \times 16^1 + 3 \times 16^0$

$= 1 \times 256 + 2 \times 16 + 3 \times 1$

$= 256 + 32 + 3 = 291$

### Step 2: Convert the fractional part (0.4) to decimal.

In hexadecimal, `4` means \( 4 \times 16^{-1} \):

$4 \times \frac{1}{16} = \frac{4}{16} = 0.25$

### Step 3: Add the whole and fractional parts together.

$291 + 0.25 = 291.25$
