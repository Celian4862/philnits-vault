For an 8-bit binary integer, which of the following sets the least significant bit to 1 while leaving the other bits unchanged?

**a) Perform bitwise AND operation with 00000001.** 
**b) Perform bitwise NAND operation with 11111110.** 
**c) Perform bitwise OR operation with 00000001.** 
**d) Perform bitwise XOR operation with 00000001.**
? 
**c) Perform bitwise OR operation with 00000001.**
## Explanation:

You want to **set the least significant bit (LSB) to 1** while **leaving the other bits unchanged** in an 8-bit binary integer.

The least significant bit is the rightmost bit in the binary number (position 0).

Suppose we have an 8-bit binary integer that is x = 10110010.

#### a) Perform bitwise AND operation with 00000001.
	x           = 10110010
	00000001    = 00000001
	-----------------------
	              00000000
This operation clears all bits except the least significant bit. It does **not** leave the other bits unchanged, so **this is incorrect**.
 
#### b) Perform bitwise NAND operation with 11111110.
	x           = 10110010
	11111110    = 11111110
	-----------------------
	              01001101
This operation **flips all bits** except the **least significant bit**, which is not what we want.

#### c) Perform bitwise OR operation with 00000001.
	x           = 10110010
	00000001    = 00000001
	-----------------------
	              10110011
This operation sets the least significant bit to `1` while leaving the rest of the bits unchanged. **This is correct**.
#### d) Perform bitwise XOR operation with 00000001.
	x           = 10110010
	00000001    = 00000001
	-----------------------
	              10110011
This changes the least significant bit if it was `0`, but if it was already `1`, XOR would change it to `0`, which is not what we want. Therefore, **this is incorrect** for numbers where the LSB is already `1`.
### Conclusion: 
**c) Perform bitwise OR operation with 00000001** is the correct answer because it sets the least significant bit to `1` and leaves the other bits unchanged.
