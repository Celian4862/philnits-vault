Which of the following is the process that is executed periodically to prevent reducing the access efficiency of the database? 

**a) Backup** 

**b) Database dump** 

**c) Reorganization** 

**d) Roll back**
?
**a) Atomicity** 
## **Explanation:**

**Reorganization** is the process of reorganizing the database's structure to improve access efficiency and performance. Over time, as data is added, modified, or deleted, the physical organization of the database may become inefficient, leading to slower access times. Periodic reorganization helps to optimize the layout of the data, reduce fragmentation, and enhance overall database performance.

### Other Options:

- **a) Backup**: This is the process of creating copies of the database to protect against data loss, but it does not specifically address access efficiency.
- **b) Database dump**: This refers to exporting the entire database to a file for backup or migration purposes, but it is not focused on maintaining or improving access efficiency.
- **d) Roll back**: This is the process of reverting a database to a previous state in case of an error or failure, but it does not relate to periodic maintenance for efficiency.

Thus, **reorganization** is the process specifically aimed at preventing reduced access efficiency in the database.
