Which of the following is the process that is executed periodically to prevent reducing the access efficiency of the database? 

**a) Backup** 

**b) Database dump** 

**c) Reorganization** 

**d) Roll back**
?
**c) Reorganization** 
## **Explanation:**

**Reorganization** is the process executed periodically to optimize the structure of the database. Over time, as data is inserted, updated, and deleted, the organization of the data can become fragmented, leading to decreased access efficiency. Reorganization helps to improve the physical layout of the data, reduce fragmentation, and enhance performance by ensuring that related data is stored closer together, which can speed up access times.

### Other Options:

- **a) Backup**: This involves creating copies of the database to safeguard against data loss, but it does not directly address access efficiency.
- **b) Database dump**: This is a method of exporting the entire database to a file for backup or migration, not focused on improving access efficiency.
- **d) Roll back**: This refers to reverting the database to a previous state in case of an error, which does not pertain to maintenance for efficiency.

Thus, **reorganization** is specifically aimed at preventing reduced access efficiency in a database.
