Which of the following is a description of the SOA? 

**a) A concept of constructing a system by considering the software functions as components called services and combining them** 

**b) A concept of improving the sales efficiency and quality by using IT for the sales activities to increase the sales and profits as well as to improve customer satisfaction** 

**c) A concept of re-designing the business processes to innovatively improve the cost, quality, service, and speed** 

**d) Outsourcing the in-house operations other than those of the core businesses to concentrate the management resources on the core businesses**
?
**a) A concept of constructing a system by considering the software functions as components called services and combining them** 
## **Explanation:**

**Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA)** is a design paradigm that focuses on organizing and utilizing software functions as distinct, interoperable services. In SOA, these services can communicate with each other over a network, enabling systems to be constructed by combining existing services. This approach promotes reusability, scalability, and flexibility in software development, as services can be developed independently and integrated into various applications.

### Overview of Other Options

- **b) A concept of improving the sales efficiency and quality by using IT for the sales activities to increase the sales and profits as well as to improve customer satisfaction**: This description aligns more closely with concepts like **Sales Force Automation (SFA)** or Customer Relationship Management (CRM) systems rather than SOA.
    
- **c) A concept of re-designing the business processes to innovatively improve the cost, quality, service, and speed**: This option describes **Business Process Reengineering (BPR)**, which focuses on improving organizational processes rather than the architectural framework of software systems.
    
- **d) Outsourcing the in-house operations other than those of the core businesses to concentrate the management resources on the core businesses**: This describes **outsourcing** rather than SOA. While outsourcing involves delegating non-core functions to third parties, it is not related to the architectural principles of software design.
    

In summary, option **a** accurately defines SOA as a framework for building systems based on services, emphasizing the modular and combinatory nature of software components.
