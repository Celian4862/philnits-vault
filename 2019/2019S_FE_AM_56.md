What is the TCO of the servers (in dollars)? 

**a) 28,100** 

**b) 120,500** 

**c) 140,500** 

**d) 622,500**
?
**c) 140,500** 
## **Explanation:**

To calculate the **Total Cost of Ownership (TCO)** of the servers over a period of 5 years, we need to consider both the **purchase price** and the **annual costs** incurred each year.

### Given:

- **Purchase Price of Servers:** $120,500
- **Annual Costs:**
    - Insurance: $2,030
    - Maintenance: $1,000
    - Repair (average): $700
    - Registration: $270

### Step 1: Calculate Total Annual Costs

$\text{Total Annual Cost} = \text{Insurance} + \text{Maintenance} + \text{Repair} + \text{Registration}$
$\text{Total Annual Cost} = 2,030 + 1,000 + 700 + 270 = 4,000$

### Step 2: Calculate Total Costs Over 5 Years

$\text{Total Costs Over 5 Years} = \text{Purchase Price} + (\text{Total Annual Cost} \times 5)$
$\text{Total Costs Over 5 Years} = 120,500 + (4,000 \times 5) = 120,500 + 20,000 = 140,500$

### **Conclusion:**

The **Total Cost of Ownership (TCO)** of the servers over 5 years is **$140,500**. Therefore, the answer is **c)**.
