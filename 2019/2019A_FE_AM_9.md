In object-oriented programming, which of the following is an explanation of overriding that achieves polymorphism?
a) A feature that allows a class to provide a specific implementation of a method that is already provided by one of its super classes 
b) Creating a class through abstraction by collecting common properties of multiple classes 
c) Defining multiple methods in a class that have the same name, but differ in terms of the number of arguments, argument types, or argument order 
d) Hiding internal contracts and structures of an object from its external specification
? 
a) A feature that allows a class to provide a specific implementation of a method that is already provided by one of its super classes 


### What is polymorphism?
	- Polymorphism is a feature of object-oriented programming languages that allows a specific routine to use variables of different types at different times. It is the ability of a programming language to present the same interface for several different underlying data types and different objects to respond in a unique way to the same message.
	- Polymorphism describes the concept that you can access objects of different types through the same interface.
