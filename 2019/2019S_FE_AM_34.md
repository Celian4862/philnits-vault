In an IPv4 network with subnet mask 255.255.255.224, what is the maximum number of host addresses assigned? 

**a) 14**

**b) 20** 

**c) 26** 

**d) 30**
?
**d) 30**
## **Explanation:**

- The subnet mask **255.255.255.224** corresponds to a **/27** prefix, which means there are **27 bits** for the network portion and **5 bits** for the host portion.
- To calculate the maximum number of host addresses:
    - Use the formula: **$2^n - 2$**, where **n** is the number of bits for the host.
    - Here, **n = 5**: $2^5 - 2 = 32 - 2 = 30$
    - The subtraction of 2 accounts for the network address and the broadcast address, which cannot be assigned to hosts.
Therefore, the answer is **d)**.
