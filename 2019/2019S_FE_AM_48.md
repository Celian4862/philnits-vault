Which of the following can generally be called a subclass of an “automobile” based on the concept of object orientation? 

**a) Engine** 

**b) Manufacturing number** 

**c) Tire** 

**d) Truck**
?
**d) Truck**
## **Explanation:**

In object-oriented programming, a **subclass** is a class that derives from another class (the superclass) and inherits its properties and behaviors. In this case, "automobile" serves as the superclass, and "truck" is a specific type of automobile, making it a valid subclass.

### Other Options Overview:

- **a) Engine**: While an engine is a critical component of an automobile, it is not a subclass; it's more of a part or attribute of the automobile.
- **b) Manufacturing number**: This is an identifier and not a subclass or type of automobile.
- **c) Tire**: Like the engine, a tire is a part of an automobile and does not qualify as a subclass.
