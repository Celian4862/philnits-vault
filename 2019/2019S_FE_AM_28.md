In a client/server system, which of the following is the mechanism that reduces the network load between the client and server by placing the frequently used commands on the DBMS on the server in advance? 

**a) Group commitment** 

**b) Multithreading of server processes** 

**c) Stored procedure** 

**d) Two-phase commitment**
?
**c) Stored procedure** 
## **Explanation:**

A **stored procedure** is a set of SQL statements that can be stored and executed on the database server. By placing frequently used commands on the DBMS (Database Management System) server, stored procedures help reduce the amount of data that needs to be sent over the network between the client and server.

### Other Options:

- **a) Group commitment**: This is a method used to improve the performance of transactions by grouping multiple transactions together for committing, but it does not specifically focus on reducing network load.
- **b) Multithreading of server processes**: This technique allows the server to handle multiple requests simultaneously, improving performance but not specifically addressing network load reduction.
- **d) Two-phase commitment**: This is a protocol used to ensure that all parts of a distributed transaction are completed successfully, but it does not relate to pre-storing commands on the server.

Thus, **stored procedures** are specifically designed to minimize network traffic by executing commands directly on the server.
