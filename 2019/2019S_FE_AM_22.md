Which of the following is an appropriate example of utilizing an RFID? 

**a) Close range transmission of data using infrared rays** 

**b) Identification and management of personnel or items by using a very small wireless chip** 

**c) Input of information by using a reader to read a digital code that is printed on a paper** 

**d) Transmission of audio data between a cellphone and headphones**
?
**b) Identification and management of personnel or items by using a very small wireless chip** 
## **Explanation:**

**RFID (Radio Frequency Identification)** is a technology that uses **radio waves** to identify and manage objects, people, or animals. It typically involves a **small wireless chip (RFID tag)** that contains data, which can be read by an **RFID reader**. This technology is commonly used in areas such as inventory management, access control, and tracking.

### Other Options:

- **a)** Incorrect: This describes **infrared communication**, not RFID. Infrared is used for short-range data transmission, but RFID uses radio waves, not infrared rays.
- **c)** Incorrect: This describes the use of **barcodes** or **QR codes**. These require optical scanning and are not related to RFID.
- **d)** Incorrect: This describes **Bluetooth or other wireless audio transmission technologies**, not RFID. RFID is not typically used for transmitting audio data.

RFID is primarily used for identification and tracking, not for data transmission like Bluetooth or infrared. Therefore, the answer is **b)**.
