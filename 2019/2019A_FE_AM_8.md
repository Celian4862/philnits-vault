The binary search algorithm is used to search for a given item when items are sorted. If the number of items is 1 million, which of the following is the closest to the maximum number of comparisons required to find the item?
a) 15 
b) 20 
c) 25 
d) 30
? 
b) 20 
### Calculating time complexity of binary search algorithm
**Time complexity of binary search**
$O_{{\log_{2}n}}$
Searching 1 million items means n = 1,000,000

$\frac{\log_{10}(1,000,000)}{\log_{10}(2)}=\log_{2}(1,000,000)$
$\log_{10}(1,000,000)=6$
$\log_{10}(2)\approx0.301$
$\frac{6}{0.301}=19.93\approx20$
