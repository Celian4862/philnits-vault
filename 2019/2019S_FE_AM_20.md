A real-time OS performs preemptive scheduling on a priority basis and schedules two (2) tasks A and B. When A has a higher priority than B, which of the following is an appropriate task management by the real-time OS? 

**a) When A is launched during the execution of B, B is assigned a “ready” status and A is executed.** 

**b) When A is launched during the execution of B, B is assigned a “waiting” status and A is executed.** 

**c) When B is launched during the execution of A, A is assigned a “ready” status and B is executed.** 

**d) When B is launched during the execution of A, A is assigned a “waiting” status and B is executed**.
?
**a) When A is launched during the execution of B, B is assigned a “ready” status and A is executed.** 
## **Explanation:**

In a **preemptive scheduling** system, tasks with **higher priority** can interrupt or "preempt" the execution of lower-priority tasks. Here’s the breakdown:

- **Task A** has **higher priority** than Task B.
- If **Task A is launched while Task B is executing**, the **real-time OS** will **pause** Task B, assigning it to a **"ready" status**.
- The system will then immediately switch to executing the **higher-priority Task A**.
- Once Task A is done, Task B can resume execution from where it was paused.

### Other Options:

- **b)** Incorrect: B should be assigned a **"ready" status**, not a **"waiting" status**. A **waiting status** is typically used when a task is waiting for an event or resource.
- **c)** Incorrect: Task B, being of **lower priority**, should not preempt Task A. Instead, Task A continues execution.
- **d)** Incorrect: Similar to c, Task A would not enter a **waiting status** for Task B, as A has a higher priority.

In **preemptive scheduling**, the higher-priority task always preempts the lower-priority one. Therefore, the answer is **a)**.
