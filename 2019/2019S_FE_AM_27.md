In an SQL statement, which of the following is a constraint that is specified with FOREIGN KEY and REFERENCES? 

**a) Assertion** 

**b) Check constraint** 

**c) Key constraint** 

**d) Referential constraint**
?
**d) Referential constraint**
## **Explanation:**

In SQL, when you define a **FOREIGN KEY** that references another table, it creates a **referential constraint**. This constraint ensures that the values in the foreign key column of a table must correspond to existing values in the primary key column of the referenced table. It maintains the **referential integrity** between two related tables.

### Other Options:

- **a) Assertion**: Assertions are more general constraints that ensure certain conditions are always true in a database, but they are not specifically tied to foreign key constraints.
- **b) Check constraint**: A **CHECK constraint** ensures that the values in a column satisfy a specified condition but is not directly related to foreign key relationships.
- **c) Key constraint**: A **key constraint** (like a primary or unique key) ensures uniqueness in a column or combination of columns but is different from a foreign key.

Thus, **referential constraint** is the correct term used for constraints defined using **FOREIGN KEY** and **REFERENCES**.
