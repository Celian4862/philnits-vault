Which of the following is an appropriate characteristic of SRAM compared to DRAM? Here, SRAM and DRAM are compared in products manufactured in the same or similar semiconductor geometric process. 

**a) SRAM consumes more power, particularly when idle, compared to DRAM.** 

**b) SRAM is non-volatile, whereas DRAM is volatile.** 

**c) SRAM needs to be refreshed, whereas DRAM does not.** 

**d) SRAM uses more transistors in a memory cell compared to DRAM.**
?
**d) SRAM uses more transistors in a memory cell compared to DRAM.**
## **Explanation:**

- **SRAM (Static Random Access Memory)** uses **six transistors** (6T) to store a single bit of data. This design allows SRAM to maintain data without needing to refresh it, making it faster and more stable than DRAM.
- **DRAM (Dynamic Random Access Memory)**, on the other hand, typically uses **one transistor and one capacitor** (1T1C) to store each bit. This design is simpler and allows DRAM to have a higher density and lower cost per bit compared to SRAM.

### Overview of Other Options:

- **a)** **SRAM consumes more power, particularly when idle, compared to DRAM.** This is incorrect; SRAM generally consumes less power when active but can consume more power during idle states.
- **b)** **SRAM is non-volatile, whereas DRAM is volatile.** This is incorrect; both SRAM and DRAM are volatile memory types, meaning they lose their stored data when power is turned off.
- **c)** **SRAM needs to be refreshed, whereas DRAM does not.** This is incorrect; DRAM requires periodic refreshing to maintain data, while SRAM does not require refreshing.

Therefore, the answer is **d)**.
