In ITIL, the reduction in the index value expressing the maintainability is cited as an example of a KPI (Key Performance Index) in availability management. Which of the following corresponds to such an index? 

**a) Mean time between failures** 

**b) Mean time between service incidents** 

**c) Mean time to restore service** 

**d) Number of interruptions in a certain period**
?
**c) Mean time to restore service**
## **Explanation:**

**Mean time to restore service (MTRS)** is a key performance indicator (KPI) in availability management, particularly in the context of maintainability. This metric measures the average time taken to restore service after a failure has occurred. It directly relates to how quickly an organization can respond to and recover from incidents, which is crucial for maintaining service availability.

The reduction in MTRS indicates improved maintainability, as it reflects the efficiency and effectiveness of the incident response and recovery processes. If the MTRS decreases over time, it suggests that the organization has implemented better practices, tools, or resources to resolve issues more quickly, thereby enhancing overall service availability.

### Overview of Other Options

- **a) Mean time between failures (MTBF)**: This metric measures the average time between system failures. It focuses more on reliability than maintainability.
    
- **b) Mean time between service incidents**: This metric indicates how often incidents occur, but it does not directly measure the time taken to recover from those incidents.
    
- **d) Number of interruptions in a certain period**: This simply counts the number of service interruptions and does not provide insight into the time required to restore service.
    

Overall, MTRS is the most relevant KPI for assessing maintainability in availability management.
