There exists a storage system in which one (1) block is composed of eight (8) sectors of 500 bytes each, and the storage area is block-wise allocated to the files. When a 2,000-byte file and 9,000-byte file are to be saved, what is the total number of sectors that is allocated to these two (2) files? Here, the sectors that are occupied by the directory information and other such management information can be ignored. 

**a) 22** 

**b) 26** 

**c) 28** 

**d) 32**
?
**d) 32**
## **Explanation:**

### Storage System Details:

- **1 block** = **8 sectors**
- **1 sector** = **500 bytes**
- Therefore, **1 block** = $8 \text{ sectors} \times 500 \text{ bytes/sector} = 4,000 \text{ bytes}$

### File Allocations:

1. **2,000-byte file:**
    
    - $\text{Sectors needed} = \lceil \frac{2000 \text{ bytes}}{500 \text{ bytes/sector}} \rceil = \lceil 4 \rceil = 4 \text{ sectors}$
	Since 4 sectors are needed, you need 1 block which houses 8 sectors. Therefore, in a 2000-byte file, 8 sectors are allocated even if the file doesn't use all sectors.
2. **9,000-byte file:**
    
    - $\text{Sectors needed} = \lceil \frac{9000 \text{ bytes}}{500 \text{ bytes/sector}} \rceil = \lceil 18 \rceil = 18 \text{ sectors}$
    Since 18 sectors are needed, you need 3 blocks which houses 24 sectors, Therefore, in a 9000-byte file, 24 sectors are allocated even if the file doesn't use all sectors.

### **Conclusion:**

So 8 + 24 = 32 sectors are allocated to these 2 files.
Therefore, the answer is **d)**.
