In 3D computer graphics, which of the following is an explanation of hidden-line removal or hidden-surface removal in rendering? 

**a) By analyzing the position of the light source and how much light hits the target object, its color and brightness are determined.** 

**b) For the generated image, only the portion that fits the computer display is rendered.** 

**c) For the target object, only the portion that is viewable from a specified viewpoint is rendered.** 
**d) Using a wireframe model with translucency, not only the surface but also the inside of the target object is rendered.**
?
**c) For the target object, only the portion that is viewable from a specified viewpoint is rendered.**
## **Explanation:**

**Hidden-line removal** or **hidden-surface removal** refers to the process in **3D computer graphics** where only the visible parts of an object from a certain viewpoint are rendered. This technique ensures that any surfaces or lines that are obscured by other parts of the object or other objects are not drawn, improving the realism of the rendered scene by showing only what would be visible to the viewer.

### Other Options:

- **a)** Incorrect: This describes **lighting and shading**, where light interaction with an object determines its appearance, such as brightness and color, but it is not related to hidden-line or hidden-surface removal.
- **b)** Incorrect: This describes **clipping**, which ensures that only the part of the scene that fits within the viewable area (such as the display) is rendered.
- **d)** Incorrect: This describes **rendering a translucent or wireframe model**, where both the surface and the internal structure can be viewed, but this is not related to hiding non-visible parts.

Hidden-line or hidden-surface removal is essential for rendering realistic 3D scenes, ensuring only visible elements from the specified viewpoint are displayed. Therefore, the answer is **c)**.
