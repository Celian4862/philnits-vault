An employee works for a department, which can be located in multiple regions. Three tables EMP, DEPT, and DEPT_LOCS are created as shown below for recording the employee, department, and department location data, respectively.

## **Explanation:**

The SQL query operates as follows:

1. **Subquery 1 (`SELECT DNO FROM DEPT`)**: This part retrieves all department numbers (DNO) from the **DEPT** table, essentially fetching the list of all departments.
    
2. **Subquery 2 (`SELECT DNO FROM DEPT_LOCS WHERE Region=’L2’)**: This part retrieves the department numbers (DNO) for departments located in the **L2** region from the **DEPT_LOCS** table.
    
3. **MINUS Operator**: The `MINUS` operator is used to exclude department numbers from Subquery 1 that are also present in Subquery 2. This results in the department numbers that are **not** located in region **L2**.
    
4. **Main Query**: The outer query selects the employee names (`EName`) and their corresponding salaries from the **EMP** table, where the department number (`DNO`) of the employee matches the department numbers retrieved by the `MINUS` operation (i.e., departments that are not located in region **L2**).
    

Given this process, the SQL query will return the employees who work for departments that are **not located in region L2**. Based on the table data:

- **John Bate** (20000) and **Sadat Hossain** (50000) are associated with departments that are not located in region **L2**.

Therefore, the answer is **b)**.
