By using the triangular distribution formula of the three-point estimation technique, which of the following is the expected duration (in days) required for an activity? The estimations are as shown below. Conditions – Estimations for the activity duration 
	Case 1: Two (2) days. If an experienced employee is assigned for this activity. 
	Case 2: Four (4) days. If a general employee is assigned for this activity. 
	Case3: Twelve (12) days. If an unexperienced employee is assigned for this activity. 
	
**a) 4** 

**b) 5** 

**c) 6** 

**d) 7**
?
**c) 6** 
## **Explanation:**

To calculate the expected duration using the **triangular distribution** formula, we use the following formula:

$\text{Expected Duration} = \frac{(O + M + P)}{3}​$

Where:

- OOO = Optimistic time (minimum duration)
- MMM = Most likely time (most probable duration)
- PPP = Pessimistic time (maximum duration)

From the conditions provided:

- Case 1 (Optimistic): 2 days
- Case 2 (Most Likely): 4 days
- Case 3 (Pessimistic): 12 days

Plugging in these values:

$\text{Expected Duration} = \frac{(2 + 4 + 12)}{3} = \frac{18}{3} = 6 \text{ days}$

Therefore, the answer is **c)**.
