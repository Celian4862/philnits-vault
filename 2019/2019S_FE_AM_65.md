**a) CSR** 

**b) Environmental assessment** 

**c) Green procurement** 

**d) Macro environment analysis**
?
**c) Green procurement** 
## **Explanation:**

**Green Procurement** refers to the process of selecting products and services that have a reduced environmental impact throughout their life cycle. This initiative involves sourcing environmentally friendly products and services that minimize waste, conserve resources, and contribute to sustainable practices. Companies that engage in green procurement actively consider environmental criteria in their purchasing decisions, aiming to support sustainability and reduce their ecological footprint.

### Overview of Other Options

- **a) CSR (Corporate Social Responsibility)**: This is a broader concept that encompasses a company's initiatives to operate ethically and contribute positively to society, including environmental, social, and economic responsibilities. While green procurement can be a part of a company's CSR strategy, CSR itself is not limited to environmentally focused initiatives.
    
- **b) Environmental Assessment**: This is a process used to evaluate the potential environmental impacts of a proposed project or action. While it involves considering environmental factors, it does not specifically refer to the selection of products and services.
    
- **d) Macro Environment Analysis**: This involves examining external factors that can impact an organization, such as economic, political, social, and technological trends. It is not specifically focused on environmental concerns or the procurement of goods and services.
    

In summary, **green procurement** is the most precise term for the initiative where a company chooses products and services aimed at addressing environmental concerns.
