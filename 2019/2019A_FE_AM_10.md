A CPU has a clock frequency of 2.0 GHz. When the instructions consist of three types, as shown in the table below, what is the approximate CPU performance in MIPS?

|     Time      | Execution Time (clocks) | Frequency of appearance ($\%$) |
| :-----------: | :---------------------: | :----------------------------: |
| Instruction 1 |           15            |               40               |
| Instruction 2 |           10            |               20               |
| Instruction 3 |           10            |               40               |
a) 16.7 
b) 120 
c) 167 
d) 200
? 
c) 167 

### Finding clock frequency
The clock frequency is given as 2.0 GHz, which is equal to $2.0\times 10^9$ cycles per second.

### Average cycles per instruction
To find the average CPI, we will multiply each instructionâ€™s clock cycles by its frequency of appearance (as a decimal), then sum them:
$CPI_{avg}=(15\times.40)+(10\times.20)+(10\times.40)=6+2+4=12$

### Calculate MIPS
$MIPS=\frac{2.0\times10^9}{12\times10^6}=\frac{2}{12}\times 10^3=0.1667\times 10^3=166.67\approx 167MIPS$
