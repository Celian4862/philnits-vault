In a memory system that has a cache memory, which of the following causes an increase in the average memory access time? 

**a) A decrease in the access time to the cache memory** 

**b) A decrease in the cache hit rate** 

**c) A decrease in the cache miss penalty** 

**d) A decrease in the cache miss rate**
?
**b) A decrease in the cache hit rate** 
## **Explanation:**

- The **average memory access time** (AMAT) is calculated using the formula:  
    $\text{Average~Memory~Access~time} = \text{Hit time} + (\text{Miss rate} \times \text{Miss penalty})$
    
- A **decrease in the cache hit rate** means that fewer memory accesses are satisfied by the cache. As a result, more accesses will require fetching data from the slower main memory, increasing the average memory access time.
### Overview of Other Options:

- **a)** **A decrease in the access time to the cache memory.** This would decrease the average memory access time since faster cache access improves the overall performance.
- **c)** **A decrease in the cache miss penalty.** This would also decrease the average memory access time, as it reduces the time taken to retrieve data from main memory when a cache miss occurs.
- **d)** **A decrease in the cache miss rate.** This would lead to a decrease in average memory access time since fewer misses mean that most accesses are satisfied by the cache.
