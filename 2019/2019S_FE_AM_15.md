A system has devices with availability R, connected as shown in the figure below. Which of the following is the expression that represents the availability of the entire system? Here, a parallel connection only requires either of the two devices to be functional, whereas a series connection requires both the devices to be functional.

**a)** $(1- (1-R)^2 )^2$ 
**b)** $(1- (1-R^2))^2$ 
**c)** $1- (1-R)^4$
**d)** $1- (1-R^2)^2$
?
**a)** $(1- (1-R)^2 )^2$ 
## **Explanation:**

1. **Parallel Connection**:
    - For two devices in parallel, the availability is given by the formula: 
	    $A_{\text{parallel}} = 1 - (1 - R)^2$
    
    This formula means the system remains available as long as at least one of the devices is functional.
    
2. **Series Connection**:
    
    - For two devices in series, the availability is simply the product of their availabilities: 
	    $A_{\text{series}} = R \times R = R^2$
### Combining the Configurations

Since the two parallel devices are connected in a series, we can denote:

- Let $A_{\text{parallel}}$ be the availability of the first parallel configuration (which consists of two devices).
- The overall availability of the series connection with the result from the parallel configuration is: $A_{\text{total}} = A_{\text{parallel}}^2 = \left(1 - (1 - R)^2\right)^2$
### **Conclusion**

The most appropriate expression representing the availability of the entire system with the described configuration is:

**a)** $(1- (1-R)^2 )^2$ 

This corresponds to the availability of the two parallel devices squared.
