Which of the following is a method for making decisions on the basis of the sum of the future cashflows discounted by a discount rate? 

**a) Internal Rate of Return Method (IRR)** 

**b) Net Present Value Method (NPV)** 

**c) PayBack Period Method (PBP)** 

**d) Return on Investment Method (ROI)**
?
**b) Net Present Value Method (NPV)** 
## **Explanation:**

The **Net Present Value (NPV) Method** is a financial analysis technique used to evaluate the profitability of an investment or project. It involves calculating the sum of future cash flows generated by the investment, discounted back to their present value using a specific discount rate. The formula for NPV is:

$\text{NPV} = \sum \left( \frac{CF_t}{(1 + r)^t} \right) - \text{Initial Investment}$

Where:

- $CF_t$â€‹ = Cash flow at time $t$
- $r$ = Discount rate
- $t$ = Time period

If the NPV is positive, it indicates that the investment is expected to generate more value than its cost, making it a worthwhile opportunity.

### Overview of Other Options

- **a) Internal Rate of Return Method (IRR):**  
    This method calculates the discount rate that makes the NPV of an investment zero. It is used to evaluate the profitability of potential investments, but it does not directly involve summing future cash flows.
    
- **c) PayBack Period Method (PBP):**  
    This method calculates the time required to recover the initial investment from cash inflows. It does not take into account the time value of money or future cash flows beyond the payback period.
    
- **d) Return on Investment Method (ROI):**  
    This method measures the gain or loss generated relative to the investment cost. It is expressed as a percentage but does not involve discounting future cash flows.
    

In summary, the NPV method is specifically designed to evaluate investment decisions based on the present value of future cash flows, making option **b** the correct choice.
