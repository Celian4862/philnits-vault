Which of the following is an appropriate explanation of the function of an actuator? 

**a) It changes an analog electrical signal into a digital electrical signal, which a computer can process.** 

**b) It changes an electrical control signal that is supplied by a computer into a mechanical motion.** 

**c) It identifies a physical quantity and changes it into an electrical signal.** 

**d) It is used in devices such as a keyboard or touch panel to enter data in a computer.**
?
**b) It changes an electrical control signal that is supplied by a computer into a mechanical motion.** 
## **Explanation:**

An **actuator** is a device that converts an **electrical control signal** into a form of **mechanical motion**. It is commonly used in control systems to perform physical tasks, such as moving a robotic arm, opening a valve, or controlling a motor.

### Other Options:

- **a)** Incorrect: This describes an **analog-to-digital converter (ADC)**, not an actuator.
- **c)** Incorrect: This describes a **sensor**, which converts a physical quantity (e.g., temperature, pressure) into an electrical signal.
- **d)** Incorrect: This describes an **input device**, such as a keyboard or touch panel, which is used for entering data into a computer.

An actuator works in the opposite direction of a sensorâ€”it takes electrical input and converts it into physical action. Therefore, the answer is **b)**.
