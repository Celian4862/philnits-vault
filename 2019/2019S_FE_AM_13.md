Which of the following is an appropriate description concerning the recording method of RAID5? 

**a) It distributes the data over multiple hard disk drives, writes the data in units of bits, and writes the ECC (Error Correction Codes) on multiple hard disk drives.** 

**b) It distributes the data over multiple hard disk drives, writes the data in units of blocks, and distributes and writes the parity on multiple hard disk drives.** 

**c) It distributes the data over multiple hard disk drives, writes the data in units of bytes, and writes the parity on one (1) hard disk drive.** 

**d) It writes the same data on two (2) hard disk drives to create a mirror disk.**
?
**b) It distributes the data over multiple hard disk drives, writes the data in units of blocks, and distributes and writes the parity on multiple hard disk drives.** 
## **Explanation:**

- **RAID 5** is a type of **redundant array of independent disks (RAID)** that provides data redundancy and improved performance.
- In RAID 5:
    - **Data is striped across multiple drives** in units called blocks. This means that data is divided into blocks and written across several disks.
    - **Parity information** (used for error recovery) is also distributed across all drives. This allows for the recovery of data in case one of the drives fails without the need for a complete mirror of the data, making RAID 5 efficient in terms of storage utilization.

### Overview of Other Options:

- **a)** **It distributes the data over multiple hard disk drives, writes the data in units of bits, and writes the ECC (Error Correction Codes) on multiple hard disk drives.**  
    This is incorrect as RAID 5 does not write in units of bits but in blocks, and it specifically uses parity rather than ECC.
    
- **c)** **It distributes the data over multiple hard disk drives, writes the data in units of bytes, and writes the parity on one (1) hard disk drive.**  
    This is incorrect; RAID 5 writes data in blocks and distributes the parity across multiple drives, not just one.
    
- **d)** **It writes the same data on two (2) hard disk drives to create a mirror disk.**  
    This describes **RAID 1**, which is a mirroring method, rather than RAID 5.
    

Thus, **b)** is the correct description of RAID 5.
