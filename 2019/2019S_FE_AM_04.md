Which of the following is an appropriate explanation of the feedback control?

**a) It performs a control in a predetermined order.** 

**b) It performs a control so that the output matches the target.** 

**c) It performs a control to avoid external disturbances to the output.** 

**d) It performs a control without using the output**
?
**b) It performs a control so that the output matches the target.** 
## **Explanation:**

**Feedback control** is a process where the output of a system is measured, and adjustments are made to ensure that the output remains aligned with the desired target or set point. The feedback loop uses the difference between the actual output and the target to adjust the system's behavior.

### Overview of other options:

- **a)** Performing control in a predetermined order describes **open-loop control**, not feedback control.
- **c)** Controlling to avoid external disturbances may describe a type of feedback control but is not a complete or precise explanation.
- **d)** Performing control without using the output refers to **open-loop control**, where feedback from the output is not used to adjust the system.
