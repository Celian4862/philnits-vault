Which of the following is an appropriate cost estimation technique that estimates the cost of an activity or project using the historical data from a similar project? 

**a) Analogous estimating** 

**b) Bottom-up estimating** 

**c) Function point method** 

**d) Parametric estimating**
?
**a) Analogous estimating** 
## **Explanation:**

**Analogous Estimating**: This technique uses the costs of similar past projects to estimate the costs of the current project. It is useful when there is limited detailed information about the project at hand but sufficient historical data is available.

### Overview of Other Options

- **b) Bottom-up estimating**: This method involves estimating the cost of each component or activity individually and then aggregating them to get the total project cost. It is usually more detailed and time-consuming.
- **c) Function point method**: This technique is specifically used in software development to estimate the size of the software project based on its functionality. It's not typically a direct cost estimation technique.
- **d) Parametric estimating**: This method uses statistical relationships between historical data and other variables (like cost per square foot) to calculate an estimate. It requires relevant parameters but is distinct from using historical project data directly.

Thus, **analogous estimating** is the correct choice for the given question.
