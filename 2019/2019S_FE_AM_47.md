Which of the following is an explanation of encapsulation in object orientation? 

**a) Abstraction and sorting of several objects that have the same nature** 

**b) Combination of the data and procedures that operate the data into a single object, and their concealment from outside the object** 

**c) Extraction of the nature shared between classes and creation of a base class** 

**d) Inheritance of the nature of a base class by a subclass**
?
**b) Combination of the data and procedures that operate the data into a single object, and their concealment from outside the object** 
## **Explanation:**

**Encapsulation** is a fundamental principle of object-oriented programming that combines data (attributes) and methods (functions) into a single unit or class. It restricts direct access to some of the object's components, which is a means of preventing unintended interference and misuse of the methods and data.

### Other Options Overview:

- **a) Abstraction and sorting of several objects that have the same nature**: This refers more to the concept of grouping similar objects but does not capture the essence of encapsulation.
- **c) Extraction of the nature shared between classes and creation of a base class**: This describes the process of **generalization** or **abstraction**, which focuses on shared characteristics, not encapsulation.
- **d) Inheritance of the nature of a base class by a subclass**: This describes **inheritance**, which allows a subclass to inherit properties and methods from a parent class, but is distinct from encapsulation.
