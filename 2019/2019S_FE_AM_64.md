Which of the following is a scheme where the user establishes a connection to the system of a service provider via the Internet and makes online use of only the necessary functions of the applications provided by the service provider at the necessary time? 

**a) ERP** 

**b) SaaS** 

**c) SCM** 

**d) XBRL**
?
**b) SaaS** 
## **Explanation:**

**SaaS (Software as a Service)** is a cloud computing model where users connect to applications hosted by a service provider over the Internet. In this model, users can access and utilize only the necessary functions of the applications on a pay-per-use or subscription basis. SaaS eliminates the need for local installation and maintenance of software, allowing for flexibility and scalability in accessing software applications as needed.

### Overview of Other Options

- **a) ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning)**: This is a type of software used to manage and integrate the essential parts of a business. While ERP systems can be delivered as SaaS, ERP itself is not a service model but rather a type of application.
    
- **c) SCM (Supply Chain Management)**: SCM refers to the management of the flow of goods and services and includes all processes that transform raw materials into final products. Like ERP, SCM can be implemented as a SaaS solution but is not a scheme itself.
    
- **d) XBRL (eXtensible Business Reporting Language)**: This is a language for the electronic communication of business and financial data. It is primarily used for reporting purposes and does not pertain to a service delivery model like SaaS.
    

In summary, **SaaS** is the most accurate option that describes a scheme where users connect to a service provider's system over the Internet to access only the necessary functions of applications as needed.
