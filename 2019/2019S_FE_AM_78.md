Which of the following is a financial statement that represents the assets, liabilities, and net assets of a company at a certain point of time and indicates the financial situation of the company? 

**a) Balance sheet** 

**b) Cash flow statement** 

**c) Income statement** 

**d) Statements of shareholders’ equity**
?
**a) Balance sheet** 
## **Explanation:**

A **balance sheet** is a financial statement that provides a snapshot of a company's financial position at a specific point in time. It details the company’s assets (what it owns), liabilities (what it owes), and net assets (equity), which represents the residual interest in the assets after deducting liabilities. The balance sheet is fundamental in assessing the financial health and stability of a company.

### Overview of Other Options

- **b) Cash flow statement:**  
    This statement summarizes the cash inflows and outflows of a company over a specific period. It focuses on cash generated from operations, investing, and financing activities, rather than providing a snapshot of the financial position at a point in time.
    
- **c) Income statement:**  
    Also known as a profit and loss statement, it reports the company’s revenues, expenses, and profits over a specific period. It measures performance over time rather than the financial position at a specific moment.
    
- **d) Statements of shareholders’ equity:**  
    This statement shows the changes in equity from transactions with shareholders (such as issuing or repurchasing shares) and the impact of profits or losses. While it provides valuable information about equity, it does not represent the overall financial position of the company like the balance sheet does.
    

In summary, the balance sheet is the financial statement that represents a company's assets, liabilities, and net assets at a specific point in time, indicating its financial situation.
