A project is planned to complete in 12 months and the budget for the completion of the project is $100,000. After six months, it is found that $60,000 are spent, but only 40% of the work is completed. If the Cost Performance Index (CPI) is not changed, what is the estimated amount (in dollars) required to complete the remaining tasks of the project? 

**a) 40,000** 

**b) 60,000** 

**c) 90,000** 

**d) 150,000**
?
**c) 90,000** 
## **Explanation:**

To estimate the amount required to complete the remaining tasks of the project, we can use the **Cost Performance Index (CPI)**. The CPI is calculated using the following formula:

$CPI = \frac{EV}{AC}â€‹$

Where:

- **EV** = Earned Value (value of work performed)
- **AC** = Actual Cost (cost incurred)

### Given:

- **Total Budget** = $100,000 (Planned Value)
- **Project Duration** = 12 months
- **Actual Cost (AC)** after 6 months = $60,000
- **Percentage of work completed** = 40%

### Step 1: Calculate Earned Value (EV)

The Earned Value (EV) can be calculated as follows:

$EV = \text{Percentage of work completed} \times \text{Total Budget}$ 
$EV = 0.4 \times 100,000 = 40,000$

### Step 2: Calculate CPI

Now, we can calculate the Cost Performance Index (CPI):

$CPI = \frac{EV}{AC} = \frac{40,000}{60,000} = \frac{2}{3} \approx 0.67$

### Step 3: Estimate Total Cost at Completion (EAC)

We can estimate the total cost at completion (EAC) using the formula:

$EAC = \frac{BAC}{CPI}$

Where **BAC** is the Budget at Completion, which is $100,000:

$EAC = \frac{100,000}{0.67} \approx 149,253$

### Step 4: Calculate Amount Required to Complete Remaining Tasks

Now, to find the estimated amount required to complete the remaining tasks, we can use the formula:

$\text{Amount Required} = EAC - AC$ 
$\text{Amount Required} = 149,253 - 60,000 \approx 89,253$

### **Conclusion:**

The estimated amount required to complete the remaining tasks of the project is approximately **90,000**. Therefore, the answer is **c)**.
