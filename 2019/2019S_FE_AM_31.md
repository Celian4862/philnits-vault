In IPv4, which of following describes the NAT function of a router that connects some computers to the Internet? 

**a) It caches the Internet access to speed up the connections when revisiting the same websites.** 

**b) It converts between private and global IP addresses.** 

**c) It inspects the IP packets in a transmission to detect possible attacks and intrusions from the Internet.** 

**d) It only passes the IP packets intended for specific terminals.**
?
**b) It converts between private and global IP addresses.** 
## **Explanation:**

**Network Address Translation (NAT)** is a function performed by routers that allows multiple devices on a local network to share a single public IP address for accessing the Internet. NAT translates the private IP addresses of the devices on the local network to a public IP address when they send data out to the Internet. When responses are received, NAT translates the public IP address back to the appropriate private IP address, ensuring that the data reaches the correct device on the local network.

### Other Options:

- **a)** Caching is not a function of NAT; it relates more to web proxies or caching servers that store frequently accessed web content to improve loading times.
- **c)** Inspecting IP packets for attacks relates to security functions such as a firewall, not specifically to NAT.
- **d)** While NAT does manage the flow of packets, it does not limit traffic to specific terminals; instead, it enables all devices behind the NAT to share the same public IP address.

Thus, **option b** accurately describes the primary function of NAT in a router.
