Which of the following is not appropriate as an application example of the IoT (Internet of Things)? 

**a) A computer that independently performs file management, arithmetic and logic operations, printing processing, and other tasks without accessing a server to avoid the security problems on the Internet** 

**b) A system that allows the manufacturer to understand the operating status, failure locations, and parts that require replacement in real-time via the Internet by having sensors and a communication function built in a large-scale construction equipment** 

**c) A system that collects automobile location information in real time and distributes the traffic jam information by communication between automobiles or between automobiles and road side units** 

**d) An electricity meter that sends information on the amount of power usage by communication with a power company in lieu of a meter reader**

**a) A computer that independently performs file management, arithmetic and logic operations, printing processing, and other tasks without accessing a server to avoid the security problems on the Internet** 
## **Explanation:**

The **Internet of Things (IoT)** refers to the network of physical devices that connect to the Internet, allowing them to collect and exchange data. IoT applications typically involve devices that communicate with each other or with centralized systems over the Internet.

- **Option a** describes a standalone computer that operates independently without connecting to the Internet. This setup does not involve any interaction with other devices or systems via the Internet, which is a fundamental characteristic of IoT applications.

### Overview of Other Options

- **b) A system that allows the manufacturer to understand the operating status, failure locations, and parts that require replacement in real-time via the Internet by having sensors and a communication function built in a large-scale construction equipment:**  
    This is a clear example of IoT, as it involves sensors and communication to provide real-time data over the Internet.
    
- **c) A system that collects automobile location information in real time and distributes the traffic jam information by communication between automobiles or between automobiles and roadside units:**  
    This is another excellent example of IoT, as it involves vehicles communicating with each other and infrastructure over the Internet to share information.
    
- **d) An electricity meter that sends information on the amount of power usage by communication with a power company in lieu of a meter reader:**  
    This is a classic IoT application, where the smart meter communicates usage data to the power company, eliminating the need for manual reading.
    

In summary, option **a** is the only choice that does not fit the IoT definition, as it describes a computer operating independently without Internet connectivity or communication with other devices.
