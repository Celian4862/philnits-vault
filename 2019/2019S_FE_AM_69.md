**a) A manufacturer distinguishes customers into profitable and non-profitable ones so that the manufacturer can provide priority services to the profitable customers.** 
## **Explanation:**

In a **push strategy**, manufacturers focus on pushing their products through the distribution channels to get them into the hands of customers. This often involves actively marketing to retailers or distributors, who then promote the products to end consumers. By distinguishing between profitable and non-profitable customers and providing priority services to the profitable ones, manufacturers are effectively pushing their products toward customers who are likely to buy, thus increasing sales and market penetration.

### Overview of Other Options

- **b) A manufacturer does his/her best to predict what customers want before producing an item or service.**  
    This approach aligns more with a **pull strategy**, where the focus is on understanding customer demand and producing based on that demand.
    
- **c) A manufacturer receives requests from customers for their own version of products or services they want, so that the manufacturer can produce them.**  
    This is also indicative of a **pull strategy**, as it involves responding directly to customer requests rather than pushing products through the supply chain.
    
- **d) A manufacturer tries to achieve much closer and one-to-one contact with the customers for producing new products.**  
    This option suggests a collaborative approach with customers, which aligns more with a **pull strategy** focused on customer-driven product development.
    

In summary, option **a** is the best example of a push strategy, as it emphasizes the manufacturerâ€™s proactive approach to segmenting and serving profitable customers to enhance product distribution and sales.
