Which of the following is the most appropriate description of a dual system? 

**a) It loads the online processing program of the active system on to a backup system and sets it to a standby status. In the event of a failure in the active system, it immediately switches to the backup system and continues the processing.** 

**b) It prepares a duplicate processor, memory, communication channel, and power supply system and continues the processing even in the event of a failure in any of the devices.** 

**c) It provides a duplicate system for performing the same processing and checks the accuracy of the processing by collating the processing results. In the event of a failure in either system, it continues the processing by the degraded operation.** 

**d) It provides an active system for performing online processing and keeps a backup system on standby while batch processing is being performed. In the event of a failure in the active system, it switches to the backup system and continues the online processing**
?
**c) It provides a duplicate system for performing the same processing and checks the accuracy of the processing by collating the processing results. In the event of a failure in either system, it continues the processing by the degraded operation.** 
## **Explanation:**

- A **dual system** a system configuration in which two CPUs perform the same processing and compare the processing results to each other. This configuration is applied when the process is not allowed to stop, even for a moment. If one CPU fails, the system cuts off the failed CPU and continues processing on the other CPU.
### Overview of Other Options:

- **a)** This describes a **hot standby system**. In this setup, a backup system is kept ready to take over the operations of an active system in the event of a failure. It emphasizes immediate availability without active processing of results by the backup system, which is common in hot standby configurations.

- **b)** This describes a **fault-tolerant system** or **redundant system**. In this configuration, all components (processors, memory, etc.) are duplicated to ensure that the system continues functioning even if one component fails. The focus here is on hardware redundancy rather than system-level redundancy or active verification of outputs.
    
- **d)** This describes a **duplex system**. In this arrangement, one system is actively processing while another is on standby, ready to take over if the active system fails. The term "duplex" is often associated with maintaining two systems that can alternate tasks but doesn't necessarily focus on cross-checking outputs like a dual system does.
    

Thus, **c)** is the correct and most suitable description of a dual system.
