Which of the following is a characteristic to guarantee that the result of an update transaction is either performed completely or canceled as if nothing happened? 

**a) Atomicity** 

**b) Consistency** 

**c) Durability** 

**d) Isolation**
?
**a) Atomicity** 
## **Explanation:**

**Atomicity** is one of the key properties of a transaction in database systems, often summarized as part of the ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) principles. It ensures that a transaction is treated as a single, indivisible unit of work. This means that either all operations within the transaction are completed successfully, or none of them are applied to the database, effectively rolling back any changes if an error occurs.

### Other Options:

- **b) Consistency**: This ensures that a transaction brings the database from one valid state to another, maintaining all predefined rules and constraints. It does not specifically guarantee the all-or-nothing property of an update.
- **c) Durability**: This guarantees that once a transaction has been committed, its effects are permanent, even in the event of a system failure. It does not relate to whether the transaction is completed or canceled.
- **d) Isolation**: This property ensures that transactions are executed in isolation from one another, meaning the operations of one transaction do not affect those of another. It does not guarantee that a transaction is completed or canceled.

Thus, **atomicity** is the characteristic that ensures the all-or-nothing nature of transactions.
