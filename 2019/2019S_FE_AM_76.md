**b) Because the boss or a senior associate imparts hands-on knowledge and technical education by staying close to practical affairs, the required competency can be acquired.** 
## **Explanation:**

**On-the-job training (OJT)** is a training method where employees learn by doing tasks under the supervision of a more experienced colleague or manager. This approach allows trainees to acquire practical skills and knowledge directly related to their job responsibilities in a real-world context. The close proximity to actual work tasks and the direct guidance from experienced personnel are key characteristics of OJT, making it effective for developing the competencies needed for specific roles.

### Overview of Other Options

- **a) A dedicated approach to education is possible by staying away from the workplace.**  
    This statement is contrary to the concept of OJT, which occurs in the workplace rather than away from it.
    
- **c) Education that focuses on generalized knowledge and technology can be received.**  
    OJT is typically more focused on specific job-related skills rather than generalized knowledge. This option does not accurately reflect the nature of OJT.
    
- **d) Regardless of the qualification of the boss or senior associate, occupational knowledge of a specific standard can be acquired.**  
    While OJT involves learning from supervisors, the effectiveness of training can vary significantly based on the qualifications and skills of the person providing the training. This option implies a lack of correlation between the trainer's qualifications and the quality of knowledge transferred, which is not typically the case.
    

In summary, option **b** accurately describes the essential characteristic of OJT as it emphasizes hands-on learning and the close supervision by experienced individuals in the workplace.
