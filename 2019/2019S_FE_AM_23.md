**a) A AND B** 

**b) A AND (A OR B)** 

**c) A OR B** 

**d) B AND (A OR B)**
?
**c) A OR B** 
## **Explanation:**

The logic circuit can be expressed as:

$(AB) + (A + B)$

This can be simplified step-by-step:

1. **Distribute** the terms:
    - The term $(A+B)$ covers all cases where either $A$ or $B$ is true, so it essentially dominates the expression (AB)(AB)(AB) because any condition satisfied by $AB$ is also satisfied by $A+B$.
2. Thus, the simplified expression is:

$A+B$

Therefore, the logical expression simplifies to:

**c)** **A OR B**
