**Which of the following can take advantage of the cell production method?** 

**a) Products that need to be mass produced to increase productivity** 

**b) Products that require division of labor by standardization, simplification, and specialization** 

**c) Products that require flexible production to produce a variety of types** 

**d) Products whose specifications do not change for a long period**
?
**c) Products that require flexible production to produce a variety of types**  
## **Explanation:**

The **cell production method** is a manufacturing approach that organizes workers into small, semi-autonomous groups (or cells) responsible for producing a range of products or product variants. This method is particularly beneficial for products that require flexible production capabilities, allowing manufacturers to quickly adapt to changes in product type or design while still maintaining efficiency. It fosters teamwork, enhances communication, and can lead to improved quality and faster response times.

### Overview of Other Options

- **a) Products that need to be mass produced to increase productivity**:  
    While cell production can be efficient, it is typically not the best choice for mass production of uniform products. Traditional assembly line methods are more suited for this type of production.
    
- **b) Products that require division of labor by standardization, simplification, and specialization**:  
    This option suggests a more traditional assembly line approach, which focuses on highly specialized tasks and standardized processes. Cell production emphasizes flexibility and teamwork rather than strict specialization.
    
- **d) Products whose specifications do not change for a long period**:  
    This scenario aligns more with batch or continuous production methods rather than cell production, which thrives on flexibility and adaptability to varying product specifications.
    

In summary, option **c** is the most fitting choice, as the cell production method is specifically designed to support flexible production and the ability to produce a variety of product types efficiently.
