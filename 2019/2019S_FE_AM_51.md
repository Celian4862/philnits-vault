Which of the following is an appropriate explanation of the PERT diagram as shown in the figure below?

**a) The critical path is A – C – G.** 

**b) This project needs at least 11 days.** 

**c) When the activity F becomes unnecessary, the project will end 1 day earlier.** 

**d) When the activity H has a delay of 2 days, it will cause the project to be delayed by 2 days.**
?
**c) When the activity F becomes unnecessary, the project will end 1 day earlier.** 
## **Explanation:**

The **Critical Path** is the longest stretch of dependent activities and is crucial for determining the project’s duration. Any delay in the activities on the critical path will result in a delay in the overall project completion. The critical path of this diagram is B - F - G as the sum of its values is 12 days. Removing F out of the equation will transfer the critical path to B - D - H whose sum of its values is equal to 11 days. Therefore, the project will end 1 day earlier.

### Other Options Overview:

- **a)** This is incorrect. The path of A - C - G only takes 8 days to complete whereas the path B - F - G takes 12 days, the longest time it takes to complete, which makes it a critical path.
- b)** This is incorrect. Since the critical path B - F - G takes 12 days to complete, the entire project takes 12 days to complete as opposed to 11.
- **d)** This is incorrect. If activity H has a delay of 2 days, the path B - D - H would certainly become the critical path of the project as it will take 13 days instead for the project to complete. However, the project would only be delayed by 1 day as the former critical path B - F - G only takes 12 days to complete.
