Which of the following is a protocol that uses TCP as its transport layer protocol? 

**a) DHCP** 

**b) SNMP** 

**c) TELNET** 

**d) TFTP**
?
**c) TELNET**
## **Explanation:**

- **TELNET**: This is a network protocol that allows for command-line interface access to remote computers. It uses **TCP** as its transport layer protocol to ensure reliable communication.

### Overview of Other Options:

- **a) DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol)**: This protocol uses **UDP** (User Datagram Protocol) rather than TCP.
- **b) SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol)**: SNMP typically operates over **UDP**, although there is a version (SNMPv3) that can use TCP.
- **d) TFTP (Trivial File Transfer Protocol)**: This protocol also uses **UDP** as its transport layer protocol, not TCP.

Thus, the only option that uses **TCP** as its transport layer protocol is **TELNET**.
