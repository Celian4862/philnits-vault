What is the Hamming distance of bit strings 10101 and 11110
a) 0
b) 2
c) 3
d) 5
? 
c) 3

### Hamming distance
	-a metric for comparing two binary data strings. While comparing two binary strings of equal length, Hamming distance is the number of bit positions in which the two bits are different.

### Calculating Hamming distance
	In order to calculate the Hamming distance between two strings, and , we perform their XOR operation, (a⊕b), and then count the total number of 1s in the resultant string.

##### Example
101 ⊕ 111 = 010, d(011, 111) = 1
011 ⊕ 101 = 110, d(011, 101) = 2
010 ⊕ 101 = 111, d(010, 101) = 3

##### Therefore
10101 ⊕ 11110 = 01011, d(10101, 11110) = 3
