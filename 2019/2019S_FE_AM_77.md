Which of the following is a description of the ABC analysis? 

**a) It analyzes a region in more detail based on various data (population, purchasing power, etc.) by dividing the region into a grid with multiple sections.** 

**b) It arranges products in the order of high sales or high gross profit, divides into levels based on the cumulative ratio, and then plans to increase the volume of the sales of products at the high levels.** 

**c) It classifies and aggregates multiple parts of the survey data by a factor and analyzes the sales capacity and status of purchasing the same products.** 

**d) It repeatedly surveys the same panelist (respondent) many times. This data is used to understand the trends in the region or changes in the purchasers.**

**b) It arranges products in the order of high sales or high gross profit, divides into levels based on the cumulative ratio, and then plans to increase the volume of the sales of products at the high levels.** 
## **Explanation:**

**ABC analysis** is an inventory management technique used to categorize items based on their importance, typically measured by sales volume or gross profit. The method divides inventory into three categories:

- **A items:** High-value products that contribute significantly to revenue (usually the top 20% of items).
- **B items:** Moderate-value products that are important but less so than A items (typically the next 30%).
- **C items:** Low-value products that contribute minimally to revenue (the remaining 50%).

By focusing on the A items, businesses can optimize their inventory management and sales strategies to enhance profitability.

### Overview of Other Options

- **a) It analyzes a region in more detail based on various data (population, purchasing power, etc.) by dividing the region into a grid with multiple sections.**  
    This describes a geographical or demographic analysis, not ABC analysis.
    
- **c) It classifies and aggregates multiple parts of the survey data by a factor and analyzes the sales capacity and status of purchasing the same products.**  
    This option refers more to data classification and analysis methods, rather than the specific inventory management focus of ABC analysis.
    
- **d) It repeatedly surveys the same panelist (respondent) many times. This data is used to understand the trends in the region or changes in the purchasers.**  
    This describes longitudinal studies in market research, which is unrelated to ABC analysis.
    

In summary, option **b** accurately describes the essence of ABC analysis as it involves categorizing products based on their sales or profit contribution to enhance sales strategies.
