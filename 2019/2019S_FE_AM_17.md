Which of the following is a method that performs data transfer between the main memory and a low-speed output device via a high-speed auxiliary storage device to increase the throughput of the entire system? 

**a) Blocking** 

**b) Paging** 

**c) Spooling** 

**d) Swapping**
?
**c) Spooling** 
## **Explanation:**

- **Spooling** (Simultaneous Peripheral Operation On-Line) is a process that allows data to be temporarily stored in a high-speed storage area (such as a disk) before being sent to a slower output device (like a printer).
- This technique enables the system to continue processing other tasks while the data is being transferred, effectively improving the overall throughput and efficiency of the system by allowing I/O operations to occur concurrently with computation.
### Overview of Other Options:

- **a)** **Blocking**: This typically refers to a method of grouping data into blocks for more efficient storage and transfer but does not directly involve the transfer process between devices as described.
    
- **b)** **Paging**: This is a memory management scheme that involves dividing memory into fixed-size pages and does not involve data transfer between a high-speed storage device and output devices.
    
- **d)** **Swapping**: This refers to the process of moving data between main memory and disk storage to free up memory but does not specifically relate to output devices or the auxiliary storage acting as a buffer for data transfer to slow devices.
    

Thus, **c) Spooling** is the correct answer as it directly addresses the data transfer method described in your question.
