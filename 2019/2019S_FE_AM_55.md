Which of the following is the most appropriate description concerning a backup method for data in a new system? 

**a) In consideration of a possible increase in the response time in the business processes, the backup schedule is adjusted so that it does not overlap with the business processes.** 

**b) To save the backup data for a long period of time, a random-access medium is used.** 

**c) To shorten the time taken for recovery from the backup data, a differential backup is used.** 

**d) To shorten the time taken for the backup process, the backup data are placed in the same storage medium as the source data.**
?
**a) In consideration of a possible increase in the response time in the business processes, the backup schedule is adjusted so that it does not overlap with the business processes.** 
## **Explanation:**

This option highlights the importance of scheduling backups during off-peak times to avoid impacting business operations, which is a critical consideration in backup strategies.

### Overview of Other Options:

- **b)** Random-access media are useful but are not specifically linked to the overall performance or operational considerations during backups.
- **c)** Differential backups speeds up the backup process, not recovery.
- **d)** Storing backups on the same medium as source data is generally not recommended due to increased risk.
