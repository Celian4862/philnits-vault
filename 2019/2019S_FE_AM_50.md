Among the software development activities, which of the following corresponds to refactoring, which is also emphasized in agile development? 

**a) To improve the maintainability of a software, the internal structure of a program is changed without any change in the external specifications.** 

**b) To improve the quality of a software, two (2) programmers cooperate with each other and perform coding of one (1) program.** 

**c) To obtain feedback from the users, a prototype of the software to be provided is created at an early stage.** 

**d) To promptly develop a software to be operated, test cases are set in advance, and then the program is coded.**

**a) To improve the maintainability of a software, the internal structure of a program is changed without any change in the external specifications.** 
## **Explanation:**

**Refactoring** is a process in software development where the internal structure of the code is improved without altering its external behavior or functionality. The goal is to make the code cleaner, more efficient, and easier to maintain, which aligns with agile development principles that emphasize adaptability and continuous improvement.

### Other Options Overview:

- **b)** This describes **pair programming**, a practice in agile development but not specifically refactoring.
- **c)** This refers to **prototyping**, which is a technique used to gather user feedback but not related to refactoring.
- **d)** This describes **test-driven development (TDD)**, where tests are created before coding, not refactoring.
