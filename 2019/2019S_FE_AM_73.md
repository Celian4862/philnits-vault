**d) The accumulated sales of the product groups that are not selling well account for a percentage that cannot be ignored against the total sales in Internet shopping.**
## **Explanation:**

The **long tail** concept refers to a business model that emphasizes selling a wide variety of products, particularly those that are not bestsellers. In the context of online retail, it highlights how niche products—those that may sell in lower quantities individually—can collectively generate significant sales. This is particularly relevant in e-commerce, where the ability to offer a vast inventory can cater to diverse customer preferences and needs, leading to substantial revenue from these less popular items.

### Overview of Other Options

- **a) A link to a company is placed on a website or blog, and the company pays a referral fee when the product is purchased via the link.**  
    This describes **affiliate marketing**, where affiliates earn commissions for driving traffic or sales to a business through their links.
    
- **b) By directly shipping products from manufacturers or wholesalers, one can sell products on his or her own website without taking a risk of inventories.**  
    This describes **dropshipping**, a retail fulfillment method where a store doesn’t keep the products it sells in stock.
    
- **c) It performs necessary processing, including integrated and systematic management, and delivery of digital content such as text and images that comprise web content.**  
    This describes content management systems (CMS) or digital asset management, which are not related to the long tail concept.
    

In summary, option **d** best captures the essence of the long tail concept by highlighting the significance of accumulated sales from niche products that contribute to overall sales in the context of online shopping.
