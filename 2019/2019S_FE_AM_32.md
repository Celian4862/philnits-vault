Which of the following is a feature of a switching hub (layer 2 switch) network device? 

**a) It breaks a received packet into smaller pieces (fragments) in the network layer.** 

**b) It dynamically allocates an IP address for a terminal connected to its LAN port.** 

**c) It forwards a received packet only to its LAN port connected to a device with the packet’s destination MAC address.** 

**d) It forwards a received packet to all its LAN ports (broadcast).**
?
**c) It forwards a received packet only to its LAN port connected to a device with the packet’s destination MAC address.** 
## **Explanation:**

A **switching hub** (or Layer 2 switch) operates primarily at the Data Link layer of the OSI model. Its main function is to receive data packets and intelligently forward them to the appropriate destination device based on the **MAC address**. By doing this, it reduces unnecessary traffic on the network and improves overall efficiency.

### Other Options:

- **a)** Fragmentation of packets is a function of Layer 3 devices (routers), which handle IP packets, not Layer 2 switches.
- **b)** Dynamically allocating an IP address is a function of a DHCP server, not a switching hub.
- **d)** Forwarding a packet to all LAN ports is characteristic of a hub, not a switching hub. A switch only sends packets to the specific port corresponding to the destination MAC address, rather than broadcasting to all ports.

Therefore, **option c** accurately describes a feature of a switching hub.
