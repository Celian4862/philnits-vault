Which of the following is the network routing and addressing mechanism that is used in IPv6 but not in IPv4? 

**a) Anycast** 

**b) Broadcast** 

**c) Multicast** 

**d) Unicast**
?
**a) Anycast**
## **Explanation:**

**Anycast** is a network addressing and routing mechanism that is used in **IPv6** but not in **IPv4**. It allows for a single address to be assigned to multiple interfaces (typically on different devices), and the network will route packets to the nearest interface (in terms of routing distance) that has that address.

### Other Options:

- **b)** **Broadcast** is used in IPv4 to send packets to all devices on a network segment, but it is not used in IPv6. IPv6 does not support broadcast; instead, it relies on multicast for similar purposes.
- **c)** **Multicast** is available in both IPv4 and IPv6 and allows packets to be sent to multiple specific devices at once.
- **d)** **Unicast** is also used in both IPv4 and IPv6 and refers to a one-to-one communication between a sender and a receiver.

Thus, **option a (Anycast)** is the only mechanism that is uniquely associated with IPv6.
