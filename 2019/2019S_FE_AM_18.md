In the figure below, data are sent continuously for T seconds from the send task to the receive task. When the volume of the data sent per second is S and volume of the data received per second is R, which of the following is an appropriate relational expression for buffer size L for a buffer that does not overflow? Here, the transmission speed for the send task is faster than the transmission speed for the receive task, and there is sufficient time between the transmissions.



**a)** $L<(R-S)\times T$ 

**b)** $L<(S-R)\times T$ 

**c)** $L\geq(R-S)\times T$ 

**d)** $L\geq(S-R)\times T$ 
?
**d)** $L\geq(S-R)\times T$  
## **Explanation:**

To determine the appropriate relational expression for buffer size $L$ for a buffer that does not overflow, we need to analyze the data transmission dynamics between the send and receive tasks over a time period $T$.

### Given:

- **Volume of data sent per second**: $S$
- **Volume of data received per second**: $R$
- **Transmission speed for the send task is faster than for the receive task**: $S>R$

### Explanation:

Since the send task transmits data at a faster rate than the receive task (i.e., $S>R$), this means that there will be a backlog of data that needs to be buffered since the send task will continually produce more data than the receive task can handle.

1. **Net Data Sent in $T$ Seconds**:
    
    - In $T$seconds, the send task will send: $\text{Total Sent} = S \times T$
2. **Net Data Received in $T$ Seconds**:
    
    - In the same $T$ seconds, the receive task will receive: $\text{Total Received} = R \times T$
3. **Net Data That Needs to Be Buffered**:
    
    - The amount of data that needs to be buffered (the difference between sent and received) is: $\text{Data to Buffer} = \text{Total Sent} - \text{Total Received} = (S \times T) - (R \times T) = (S - R) \times T$

### Buffer Size Requirement:

For the buffer to not overflow, the buffer size $L$ must be at least equal to the amount of data that needs to be buffered:

$L \geq (S - R) \times T$

### **Conclusion:**

Thus, the appropriate relational expression for buffer size $L$ is:

**d)** $L \geq (S - R) \times T$

This means the buffer size must accommodate the excess data sent by the send task over the data received by the receive task within the specified time period $T$.
