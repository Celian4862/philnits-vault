Which of the following is a use case of deep learning to improve the performance of an in-car device? 

**a) An accelerometer detects the collision of the vehicle against a wall and causes the air bag to blow up, thus protecting the passenger from injury.** 

**b) By installing equipment that automatically performs idling stop, the fuel efficiency improves as compared with the case when a driver with a vast experience of driving drives a vehicle.** 

**c) By the acquisition and processing of numerous images, the driver assistance system can distinguish between a pedestrian and vehicle more reliably.** 

**d) The navigation system updates the software by a mobile phone line and refreshes the map.**

**c) By the acquisition and processing of numerous images, the driver assistance system can distinguish between a pedestrian and vehicle more reliably.** 
## **Explanation:**

**Deep learning** is a subset of machine learning that utilizes neural networks with many layers to analyze various forms of data, particularly images. In the context of an in-car device, deep learning can significantly enhance the performance of driver assistance systems by enabling them to analyze and interpret visual data from cameras. This capability allows the system to reliably distinguish between different objects, such as pedestrians and vehicles, which is crucial for improving safety and automating features like collision avoidance.

### Overview of Other Options

- **a) An accelerometer detects the collision of the vehicle against a wall and causes the airbag to blow up, thus protecting the passenger from injury.**  
    This describes a traditional safety system relying on sensors and predefined algorithms, not deep learning.
    
- **b) By installing equipment that automatically performs idling stop, the fuel efficiency improves as compared with the case when a driver with vast experience of driving drives a vehicle.**  
    This relates to a fuel efficiency improvement technology, likely based on control systems rather than deep learning.
    
- **d) The navigation system updates the software by a mobile phone line and refreshes the map.**  
    This describes a software update process and does not involve deep learning techniques.
    

In summary, option **c** is the best example of how deep learning can be applied to enhance the performance of in-car devices, specifically through the analysis of image data for better object recognition.
