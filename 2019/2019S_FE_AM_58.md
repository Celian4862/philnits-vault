Which of the following is the system audit implementation structure that should be avoided from the standpoint of independence of the system auditors? 

**a) A person, who five (5) years ago was transferred to the audit department from a development manager position in the information systems department, audits the status of the Internet usage in the marketing department.** 

**b) A person in the audit department audits the status of the personal information management in the external contractor to whom personal information handling is outsourced.** 

**c) A person in the general affairs department, who is appointed as a member of the audit team, audits the status of the entrance and exit control in the general affairs department, together with the other members.** 

**d) A person in the legal department, in response to a request by the audit department, cooperates with the auditors in auditing of the validity of the outsourcing contracts**
?
**c) A person in the general affairs department, who is appointed as a member of the audit team, audits the status of the entrance and exit control in the general affairs department, together with the other members.** 
## **Explanation:**

In this scenario, the individual from the **general affairs department** auditing their own department raises significant **independence concerns**. Auditing one's own department can create a conflict of interest and compromise the objectivity of the audit. This situation may lead to:

- **Bias**: The auditor might have a personal stake in the outcome and may unconsciously (or consciously) overlook issues or fail to report them accurately.
- **Lack of Objectivity**: The auditor may not be able to provide an unbiased perspective when assessing processes or controls they are directly involved with.
- **Credibility Issues**: Stakeholders may question the findings and conclusions of the audit if they know the auditor is part of the same department, leading to potential distrust in the audit process.

### Overview of Other Options

- **a)** A person, who five (5) years ago was transferred to the audit department from a development manager position in the information systems department, audits the status of the Internet usage in the marketing department: Although there may be some residual connections, the auditor is now in the audit department, which helps to establish some independence.
    
- **b)** A person in the audit department audits the status of the personal information management in the external contractor to whom personal information handling is outsourced: This is acceptable as the auditor is from the audit department and assessing an external entity, ensuring independence.
    
- **d)** A person in the legal department, in response to a request by the audit department, cooperates with the auditors in auditing the validity of the outsourcing contracts: This collaboration is acceptable as it does not involve the legal department conducting the audit but rather providing necessary expertise, preserving the independence of the audit process.
