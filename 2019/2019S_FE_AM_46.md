![[Pasted image 20241020162314.png]]

**a) Aggregation** 

**b) Association** 

**c) Composition** 

**d) Generalization**
?
**d) Generalization**
## **Explanation:**

- **Generalization** is a relationship where one class (the child) inherits the properties and behaviors of another class (the parent). It represents an "is-a" relationship.
- In UML, this is depicted with a hollow triangle pointing towards the parent class from the child class.

### Other Options Overview:

- **Aggregation**: Represents a whole-part relationship but implies that the part can exist independently of the whole. It's often depicted with an empty diamond.
- **Association**: Represents a relationship between two classes without implying ownership. It's shown with a solid line.
- **Composition**: A stronger form of aggregation where the part cannot exist without the whole. It's depicted with a filled diamond.
