b) DMA control architecture
c) Stored program architecture 
d) Virtual memory system

c) Stored program architecture
## Definitions
### Addressing system
- computer system
- refers to the method used by a computer to access memory locations.

### DMA control architecture
- control architecture
- Direct Memory Access (DMA)
- allows peripherals to access the main memory independently of the CPU

### Stored program architecture (ANSWER)
- computer architecture
- instructions to be executed are ==stored in the main memory alongside the data==
- ==CPU sequentially fetches and executes these instructions==

### Virtual memory system
- computer system
- allows a computer to use disk storage as an extension of RAM
