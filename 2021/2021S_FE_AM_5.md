The table below is a state transition table used for character string validation. In this table, “$A$” represents the initial state, and “$E$” represents the failure state. Which of the following is a character string that fails this validation? Here, each character of a string is parsed from the leftmost side, and the symbol “$\triangle$” represents a blank character.

a) $+0010$
b) $-1$
c) $12.2$
d) $\triangle$
? 
c) $12.2$
## Solution
We run through each option to the state transition table.
Always go to State A (first row) in the beginning.

**Goal:** Get an option that will go to State E
### Step 1: Run through option a)
Our string would be: $+0010$

First character: `+` = Sign $\rightarrow$ go to state C (3rd row)
Next character: `0` = Number $\rightarrow$ go to state B (2nd row)
Next character: `0` = Number $\rightarrow$ go to state B
Next character: `1` = Number $\rightarrow$ go to state B
Next character: `0` = Number $\rightarrow$ go to state B

**NOT A FAILURE**

### Step 2: Run through option b)
Our string would be: $-1$

First character: `-` = Sign $\rightarrow$ go to state C
Next character: `1` = Number $\rightarrow$ go to state B

**NOT A FAILURE**

### Step 3: Run through option c)
Our string would be: $12.2$

First character: `1` = Number $\rightarrow$ go to state B
Next character: `2` = Number $\rightarrow$ go to state B
Next character: `.` = Radix point $\rightarrow$ go to state D
Next character: `2` = Number $\rightarrow$ go to state E

**FAILURE**

### Hence, c) is the answer
