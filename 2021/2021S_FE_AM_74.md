When real-time systems are classified into hard real-time and soft real-time systems, which
of the following is in the category of a hard real-time system?

a) Airbag control system 
b) Bank ATM system
c) Seat reservation system 
d) Web delivery system
? 
a) Airbag control system 

## Explanation

**Real Time System** 
- system in which:
	- a job has a deadline, 
	- and the job has to be finished by the deadline (strictly finished). 
	- if a result is delayed, a huge loss may happen
- two types:
	- hard
		- operation is incorrect when ==result is not produced according to time constraint==
		- examples:
			1. Air Traffic Control
			2. Medical System
	- soft
		- Â timely processing is desirable but late processing do not cause the system to fail
		- examples:
			1. Multimedia Transmission and Reception
			2. Computer Games 
			3. Communication system like voice over Ip


**NOTE:** Why not b) ? 
- because despite needing to be reliable and timely functions it does not cause huge losses
- the choice to improve security and reliability prevents such losses 
- compared to an airbag system where the timing to pop the airbag is crucial to saving a life, a slight millisecond delay can cost a life
