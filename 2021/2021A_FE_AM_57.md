In IT service management, which of the following is handled by incident management?

a) Inquiry regarding the function or usage of the IT service or system 
b) Long delay in an application response 
c) Request for providing the IT service to a new business site 
d) Request for training of recruits on the IT service
? 
b) Long delay in an application response 
### Explanation

Incident management is responsible for handling any disruptions to normal service operations, including issues like long delays in application responses. These are considered incidents because they affect the quality or availability of IT services, and the goal of incident management is to restore normal service operation as quickly as possible.

### Why the Others Won't Fit

**a) Inquiry regarding the function or usage of the IT service or system.**

- This is typically handled by a **service desk** or **help desk** as a service request, not incident management, since it's more of an inquiry than an issue affecting service performance.

**c) Request for providing the IT service to a new business site.**

- This would fall under **request fulfillment** or **change management**, as it involves provisioning new services rather than resolving an incident.

**d) Request for training of recruits on the IT service.**

- This is a service request, not an incident. It would typically be handled through **service request management** rather than incident management.
