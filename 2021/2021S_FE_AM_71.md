The figure below shows the relationships among the components of product A, and the numbers in parentheses indicate the quantity of components necessary to produce one unit of the upper-level product or component. When 10 units of product A are produced, how many units of component C must be ordered? Here, there are presently five units of component C in the inventory.

a) 15 
b) 20 
c) 25 
d) 30
? 
c) 25
### Step 1: Identify focus component
Based on the instruction, we focus on Component C

- we have a spare of 5 C components
- when constructing product A we need a total of 2 C components:
	- one (1) from creating prod A directly
	- two (2) from creating 2 component Bs
		- each component B, requires one (1) component C

### Step 2: Multiply all variables by 10
Focusing on component C, we should get:
$$\begin{align}
A &= 2B+C \\
10 \cdot A &= 10 \cdot ( 2B  + C )\\
10A &= 10 \cdot 2(D+E+C)  + 10C \\
10A &= 20D+20E+20C  + 10C \\
10A &=20D+20E+\boxed{30C}
\end{align}$$
From the product line of creating 10 Product As we get `30 component Cs`.

### Step 3: Finishing up
Since we still have a stock of 5 C components:

$\text{Total } = 30C - 5C = \boxed{25C}$

$\therefore$ We need to order `25 C Components`
### Hence the answer is c)
