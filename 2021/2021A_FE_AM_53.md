When the duration for painting a house is estimated, which of the following is an appropriate technique that estimates the duration on the basis of the actual duration of a similar painting job in the past of the same house or other historical data from similar work? 

a) Analogous estimate
b) Parametric estimate
c) Reserve analysis
d) Three-point estimate
? 
a) Analogous estimate
### Explanation

An analogous estimate uses the actual duration of a similar past project or job as a basis for estimating the duration of the current project. In this case, the time it took to paint the same house or another similar house in the past serves as the reference for the new estimate. This technique is commonly used when detailed information is limited and relies on expert judgment and historical data.

### Why the Others Won't Fit

**b) Parametric estimate.**

- A parametric estimate uses statistical relationships between variables (e.g., cost per square foot) to estimate project duration, which is different from relying on direct past experience or historical data of a similar job.

**c) Reserve analysis.**

- Reserve analysis involves adding contingency reserves to the estimate to account for uncertainties, but it does not rely on historical data to estimate the base duration.

**d) Three-point estimate.**

- A three-point estimate uses optimistic, pessimistic, and most likely duration estimates to calculate an expected duration, but it doesn't specifically rely on past similar jobs or historical data.
