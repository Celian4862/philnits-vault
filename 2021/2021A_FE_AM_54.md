In system development, when the relationship between person-months and the duration (months) is represented in the approximate expression shown below, and the total person-month is 4096, how many months does it take? 

Duration = 2.5 $\times$ $person-months^\frac{^1}{3}$ 

a) 16
b) 40 
c) 64 
d) 160
? 
a) Analogous estimate
### Explanation

To find the duration in months, we are given the formula:

Duration=2.5×(person-months)1/3\text{Duration} = 2.5 \times (\text{person-months})^{1/3}Duration=2.5×(person-months)1/3

And the total person-months is 4096. Let's calculate the duration step by step:

Duration=2.5×(4096)1/3\text{Duration} = 2.5 \times (4096)^{1/3}Duration=2.5×(4096)1/3

1. First, calculate the cube root of 4096:

(4096)1/3=16(4096)^{1/3} = 16(4096)1/3=16

2. Now multiply the result by 2.5:

Duration=2.5×16=40\text{Duration} = 2.5 \times 16 = 40Duration=2.5×16=40

Therefore, the duration is **40 months**.

The correct answer is **b) 40**.
