In a TCP/IP environment, which of the following is a protocol for synchronizing the clocks of multiple computers with that of a time server?

a) FTP 
b) NNTP 
c) NTP 
d) RTP
? 
c) NTP 
### Explanation

**NTP (Network Time Protocol)** is a protocol used to synchronize the clocks of multiple computers to a precise time source, such as a time server or an atomic clock, over a TCP/IP network. NTP ensures that all devices on a network maintain the same time, which is critical for time-sensitive processes, logging, and security functions.
### Why the Others Won't Fit

**a) FTP (File Transfer Protocol)**:

- **FTP** is a protocol used for transferring files between computers on a network, but it is not related to time synchronization.

**b) NNTP (Network News Transfer Protocol)**:

- **NNTP** is a protocol used for reading and posting messages to newsgroups (online forums), and it is not used for synchronizing time.

**d) RTP (Real-Time Transport Protocol)**:

- **RTP** is a protocol used for delivering audio and video over IP networks in real-time. It is not used for clock synchronization.
