A student’s ID, name, and class ID are recorded in the Student table. Which of the
following SQL returns records of all students whose names start with A?

a) SELECT * FROM Student WHERE name LIKE ’%A’;
b) SELECT * FROM Student WHERE name LIKE ‘%A_’;
c) SELECT * FROM Student WHERE name LIKE ‘A_’;
d) SELECT * FROM Student WHERE name LIKE ‘A%’;
? 
d) SELECT * FROM Student WHERE name LIKE ‘A%’;

## Explanation

Recall `SQL`, specifically the `LIKE` operator:
- used in a `WHERE` clause to search for a specified pattern in a column.
- Has wildcards:
	- percent sign `%` represents zero, one, or multiple characters
		- `%A` - any as long as last character is `A`
		- ==`A%` - any as long as first character is `A`==
		- `%A%` - any as long as there is a character `A` in between
		- positional
	- underscore sign `_` represents one, single character
		- `A_` - first character is `A` and next/last character is any
		-  and the like (positional)
