Which of the following is equivalent to the logic expression below?
$$
\begin{flalign}
(x+y)\cdot(x+z)&&
\end{flalign}
$$
Here, the letters are logic variables; $x+y$, $x\cdot y$, and $\bar{x}$ are OR, AND, and NOT operations on the corresponding variables, respectively.

a) $x\cdot(y+z)$
b) $x+y\cdot z$
c) $x\cdot y+y\cdot z$
d) $(\bar{x}+y)\cdot z$
? 
b) $x+y\cdot z$
### Step 1: Refer to Boolean algebra identities

**Goal:** is to find the most similar form with the given equation
**Answer**: Distributive law is the most similar

The distributive law states that:
$A+BC = (A+B)\cdot(A+C)$

### Step 2: Apply Distributive Law

**Goal**: Substitute distributive law equation with the actual variables
**Answer**:
	$(x+y)\cdot(x+z) = ?$      *(original equation)*
	$(A+B)\cdot(A+C) = A+B\cdot C$

	$A = x$
	$B = y$
	$C = z$

$\therefore$ Resulting into the final equation
$(x+y)\cdot(x+z) = \boxed{x+y\cdot z}$

### Hence, the answer would be **b)**
