Which of the following is an appropriate explanation of DHCP?

a) It is a protocol for accessing a directory service. 
b) It is a protocol for automatically assigning an IP address. 
c) It is a protocol for converting a private IP address to a global IP address. 
d) It is a protocol for forwarding an e-mail.
? 
b) It is a protocol for automatically assigning an IP address. 
### Explanation

**DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol)** is a protocol used to automatically assign IP addresses to devices on a network. When a device connects to a network, it sends a request to the DHCP server, which then provides the device with an IP address, along with other configuration information such as the subnet mask, default gateway, and DNS server addresses. This process simplifies network management by avoiding the need for manual IP address assignment.
### Why the Others Won't Fit

**a) It is a protocol for accessing a directory service**:

- This describes **LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol)**, which is used to access and manage directory services, not to assign IP addresses.

**c) It is a protocol for converting a private IP address to a global IP address**:

- This describes **NAT (Network Address Translation)**, which translates private IP addresses to public (global) IP addresses, not the automatic assignment of IP addresses.

**d) It is a protocol for forwarding an e-mail**:

- This describes **SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol)**, which is used to send and forward emails, not for IP address assignment.
