Which of the following is an appropriate relationship between classes and instances in object orientation?

a) An instance defines the specifications of a class.
b) An instance is created based on the definition of a class.
c) Multiple classes correspond to a single instance.
d) Only one (1) instance exists for a single class.
? 
b) An instance is created based on the definition of a class.
### Explanation

This option accurately describes the relationship in object-oriented programming (OOP). A class serves as a blueprint or template that defines the properties and behaviors (methods) of objects. An instance, also known as an object, is created using this blueprint, encapsulating the data and functionality defined by the class. Each instance can have its own unique state while adhering to the structure and rules established by the class.
### Why the Others Won't Fit

**a) An instance defines the specifications of a class.**

- This statement is incorrect because it reverses the relationship. A class defines the specifications and behavior that instances will follow, not the other way around.

**c) Multiple classes correspond to a single instance.**

- This is misleading. An instance is typically associated with one specific class. While an instance can inherit characteristics from multiple classes in some programming paradigms (like multiple inheritance), it is still tied to a specific class definition.

**d) Only one (1) instance exists for a single class.**

- This statement is also false. A class can have multiple instances created from it. Each instance represents a unique object that can have different values for its properties while following the same class structure.
