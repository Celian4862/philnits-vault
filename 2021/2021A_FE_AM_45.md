### Explanation

- **Generalization:** In UML, a generalization relationship indicates that one class (subclass) is a specialized version of another class (superclass). This is often represented by a hollow triangle pointing from the subclass to the superclass.
- **Option c:** In this diagram, the `Sports car` class is shown as a specialized version of the `Automobile` class. The hollow triangle pointing from `Sports car` to `Automobile` signifies this generalization relationship.

### Why the Others Won't Fit

**a) shows a composition relationship, where one object (Automobile inspection certificate) is part of another object (Automobile).

**b) shows an association relationship, indicating a connection between two classes (Automobile and Driver).

**d) shows an aggregation relationship, where one object (Automobile) is composed of multiple other objects (Tire and Engine).
