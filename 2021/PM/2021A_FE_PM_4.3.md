The answers can be inferred from the network traffic rules that were implemented. 2 services were said to be mapped to the mail server in the DMZ, being IMAP and SMTP. Since SMTP was already present on the table, the only remaining choice would be SMTP.

In rule 3 it is mentioned that DMZ is allowed access to the internet via the NAT protocol. For this reason, it can be assumed that the translation for DMZ - Internet communication would be handled via NAT.
