## Explanation

The answer for D is Food ID since it is the only lacking required input in order to use the system. Without a food ID, the customer's order would be unknown

The answer for E is number of dishes since it is required in the case that the customer wants to order more than one of the same dish once he has chosen it.

The final answer for F is pickup time as it was also mentioned in the app specifications but not yet mentioned here within this table.
