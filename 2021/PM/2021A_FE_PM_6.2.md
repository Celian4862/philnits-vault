## Explanation

The given code snippet describes a scenario where the `Encrypt` function can also be used for decryption if the arguments are given appropriately. However, there's a problem when the values of `keyEven` or `keyodd` are outside the range of 0 to 25.

To address this issue, the code introduces two new statements to convert any given `keyEven` and `keyodd` values into the prescribed range of 0 to 25.

**G:** `keyEven = (keyEven % 26 + 26) % 26;`

**H:** `keyodd = (keyodd % 26 + 26) % 26;`

Here's a breakdown of why these are the correct choices:

**Explanation:**

The given code snippet describes a scenario where the `Encrypt` function can also be used for decryption if the arguments are given appropriately. However, there's a problem when the values of `keyEven` or `keyodd` are outside the range of 0 to 25.

To address this issue, the code introduces two new statements to convert any given `keyEven` and `keyodd` values into the prescribed range of 0 to 25.

The provided options for G and H involve using the modulo operator `%`. The modulo operator returns the remainder of a division operation.

By using `(keyEven % 26 + 26) % 26`, we effectively ensure that `keyEven` is always within the range of 0 to 25.

Similarly, `(keyodd % 26 + 26) % 26` ensures that `keyodd` is within the desired range.
