## Explanation

From this table, we can see that the IP address and default gateway are mismatched. The issue is caused by a DHCP server misconfiguration, as identified through the incorrect IP address setup of **PC-B#1**.

The **Default Gateway** is set to **172.16.1.1**, which is incorrect because this address belongs to **Router A** in **Network A**. The incorrect default gateway (172.16.1.1) prevents the PCs in **Network B** from accessing resources outside of their local network (like the DMZ or Network A). This explains the reasoning behind the answer of option b.

After correcting the DHCP serverâ€™s configuration (as seen in **Table 2**), the **default gateway** for PCs in **Network B** should be the IP address of **Router B**.

- The default gateway for **Network B** should be **172.16.2.1** (option **c**), as this is the IP address of **Router B**.
