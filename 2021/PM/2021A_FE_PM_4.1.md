## Explanation

A DHCP Server isÂ **a network server that automatically provides and assigns IP addresses, default gateways and other network parameters to client devices**. It relies on the standard protocol known as Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol or DHCP to respond to broadcast queries by clients.

- The DHCP server is running on **Network B**, and PCs in **Network A** need to obtain IP addresses from this DHCP server.
- DHCP broadcast requests are normally limited to the same physical network, hence a **DHCP relay agent** is needed on **Router A**.
- The relay agent forwards the DHCP request from Network A to the DHCP server in **Network B**

### Given from the description:

- Network A: **172.16.1.0/24** (Tech team PCs: 172.16.1.50 to 172.16.1.200)
- Network B: **172.16.2.0/24** (Solution team PCs: 172.16.2.50 to 172.16.2.200, DHCP server: 172.16.2.10)

In the scenario, a **DHCP server** is running in **Network B**. For clients in **Network A** to get IP addresses from this DHCP server, a **DHCP relay agent** on **Router A** is needed because **DHCP broadcasts** are typically limited to the local network (i.e., a broadcast domain). This relay agent forwards DHCP requests between networks.

Since the question is asking for what is the typical network from which it will accept DHCP requests, the answer would be Option D (172.16.2.0/24), where the DHCP server resides.
    - This means the DHCP server will initially respond only to requests within this subnet, which is **172.16.2.0/24**

The second blank refers to the **destination address of a forwarded request** from the DHCP relay agent on **Router A** to the DHCP server in **Network B**.

From the diagram, we can see that the **DHCP server** has an IP address of **172.16.2.10** in **Network B**.

Therefore, the correct answer for B is **option g (172.16.2.10)**, as this is the specific destination address where the DHCP relay agent forwards requests.
