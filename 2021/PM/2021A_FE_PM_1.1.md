## Explanation

A brief overview of public key cryptography:

1. **Signing**: The sender uses their **private key** to sign the message, creating a digital signature. This ensures the message's authenticity (i.e., it came from the sender) and integrity (i.e., it hasn’t been tampered with).
2. **Verification**: The recipient (or anyone) can then use the sender’s **public key** to verify the signature, confirming that the message was indeed signed by the sender and has not been altered.
### For the sending of the catalogue:

1. **Sign using (A)**: This would be **Alice's private key**. Alice signs the message (Catalogue) using her private key.
2. **Verify using (B)**: This would be **Alice's public key**. The receiver (Charlie) verifies the signed message using Alice’s public key to ensure authenticity.

### For Bob's Reply to Alice:

1. **Encrypt using (B)**: This would be **Alice's public key**. Bob encrypts the order information message using Alice’s public key, ensuring that only Alice can decrypt it.
3. **Verify using (D)**: This would be **Bob's public key**. Alice uses Bob’s public key to verify that the message was signed by Bob.
