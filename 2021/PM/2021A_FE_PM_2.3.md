## Explanation

1. **Analyze the truth table:** Carefully examine the truth table for the relationship between the input Gray codes (G1, G2, G3, G4) and the output binary codes (B1, B2, B3, B4).
2. **Identify the pattern:** Observe how the values of B1, B2, and B3 change based on the values of G1, G2, and G3. You'll notice that the value of B3 changes whenever the values of G1 and G2 are different, or when the value of G3 changes.
3. **Apply logical operations:**
    - The XOR operation (⊕) can be used to detect when two bits are different. So, G1⊕G2 will be 1 when G1 and G2 are different, and 0 when they are the same.
    - To account for changes in G3, we can simply XOR the result of G1⊕G2 with G3.
4. **Verify the formula:** Test the formula (G1⊕G2)⊕G3 with different input values to ensure it produces the correct output for B3.

Therefore, the logical formula for B3 is (G1⊕G2)⊕G3.
