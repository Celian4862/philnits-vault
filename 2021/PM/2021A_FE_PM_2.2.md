## Explanation

The question asks for a logical formula that converts binary codes into equivalent Gray codes based on the truth table shown. The table lists 4-bit binary codes as inputs (B1, B2, B3, B4) and 4-bit Gray codes as outputs (G1, G2, G3, G4). To fill the blank, we need to derive the relationships between the binary inputs and Gray code outputs.
### Observing the Truth Table

From the table, we see the following pattern for Gray code output based on the binary inputs:

- **G1**: This bit is directly copied from **B1**. For all rows, G1 and B1 are identical.
    
    - Therefore, **G1 = B1**.
- **G2**: This bit is the result of an XOR operation between **B1** and **B2**.
    
    - Example: For row 1, B1 = 0, B2 = 0, and G2 = 0. XOR(0, 0) = 0.  
        For row 4, B1 = 0, B2 = 1, and G2 = 1. XOR(0, 1) = 1.
    - Therefore, **G2 = B1 ⊕ B2**.
- **G3**: This bit is the result of an XOR between **B2** and **B3**.
    
    - Example: For row 5, B2 = 0, B3 = 1, and G3 = 1. XOR(0, 1) = 1.
    - Therefore, **G3 = B2 ⊕ B3**.
- **G4**: This bit is the result of an XOR between **B3** and **B4**.
    
    - Example: For row 7, B3 = 1, B4 = 0, and G4 = 1. XOR(1, 0) = 1.
    - Therefore, **G4 = B3 ⊕ B4**.
