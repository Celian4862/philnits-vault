## Explanation

The Hamming distance is the number of positions at which the corresponding bits differ between two binary numbers.

Binary codes:

- 1001
- 1010

We can see that:

- The first bit is the same (1 and 1).
- The second bit is different (0 and 1).
- The third bit is the same (0 and 0).
- The fourth bit is different (1 and 0).

Thus, there are 2 positions where the bits differ. So, **A = 2**.

The Gray code should have a Hamming distance of 1 between adjacent codes. From the table we can see:

- Check from decimal 0 to 15, comparing adjacent binary codes in the Gray code column. As per the Gray code property, the Hamming distance between any adjacent pair is always 1.

For the largest Hamming distance, we need to identify **adjacent binary codes** with the highest difference in the number of bits that change between their gray code representations. The gray codes for 7 and 8 are:

- 0111 (for 7)
- 1000 (for 8)

There is a difference in 3 positions (bits), so the Hamming distance is 3, which is the largest.

Thus, **B = 7** and **D = 4**.
