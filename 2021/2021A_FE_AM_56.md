Which of the following is the main purpose of a migration test for a system?

a) To confirm that a new system possesses all of the required functions 
b) To confirm that sufficient performance can be derived from the new system using a copy of the actual data from the existing system 
c) To confirm the compatibility of the interface between a program of another existing system and a newly developed program 
d) To confirm the switch procedure from the existing system to the new system and the problems that the switch can cause from the perspective of reliability and efficiency
? 
d) To confirm the switch procedure from the existing system to the new system and the problems that the switch can cause from the perspective of reliability and efficiency
### Explanation

The primary purpose of a migration test is to ensure a smooth transition from the existing system to the new system. This includes testing the switch procedure and identifying potential issues related to reliability and efficiency during the migration process. It focuses on how well the new system integrates, handles data migration, and how the changeover affects overall operations.

### Why the Others Won't Fit

**a) To confirm that a new system possesses all of the required functions.**

- This is more aligned with functional testing, which ensures that the system meets its functional requirements.

**b) To confirm that sufficient performance can be derived from the new system using a copy of the actual data from the existing system.**

- This describes performance testing, which focuses on how well the new system performs under real-world conditions with actual data.

**c) To confirm the compatibility of the interface between a program of another existing system and a newly developed program.**

- This refers to interface testing, which verifies that the new system can communicate effectively with other existing systems or components.
