The half adder in the diagram below adds two (2) single-digit binary numbers, x and y, and produces z (the first digit of the sum) and c (the carry bit) as outputs. Which of the following is the appropriate combination of gate devices A and B?

| <br>    | A                               | B                           |
| ------- | ------------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| a) <br> | Exclusive logical sum (XOR)     | Logical product (AND)       |
| b)      | Logical product (AND)           | Logical sum (OR)            |
| c)      | Negative logical product (NAND) | Negative logical sum (NOR)  |
| d)      | Negative logical sum (NOR)      | Exclusive logical sum (XOR) |


? 

| a) <br> | Exclusive logical sum (XOR) | Logical product (AND) |

## Explanation
Recall definition of and **adder** circuit
- sum bit becomes 1 ONLY when 
	- $x$ = 1 and $y$ = 0
	- $x$ = 0 and $y$ = 1
	-  ==XOR==
- carry bit becomes 1 ONLY when
	- $x$ and $y$ = 1
	- ==AND==

### Truth table of adder 

|  x  |  y  |  z  |  c  |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| $0$ | $0$ | $0$ | $0$ |
| $0$ | $1$ | $1$ | $0$ |
| $1$ | $0$ | $1$ | $0$ |
| $1$ | $1$ | $0$ | $1$ |
