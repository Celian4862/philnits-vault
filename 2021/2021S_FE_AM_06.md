Which of the following is an appropriate description of parity check (vertical parity) that handles transmission errors on a communication line?

a) A parity check can correct 1-bit and 2-bit errors.
b) A parity check can detect a 1-bit error.
c) An odd parity check can detect a 1-bit error, but an even parity check cannot even detect
a 1-bit error.
d) An odd parity check can detect any odd number of bit errors, and an even parity check
can detect any even number of bit errors.
? 
b) A parity check can detect a 1-bit error.

### Parity Check Definition
- adds an extra bit named `parity bit`
- checks if the number of `1 bits` excluding itself
- two types of `parity bits`:
	1) odd - checks if the no. of `1 bits` is odd
	2) even - checks if the no. of  `1 bits` is even
- very simple
- error prone
- 1-bit error checker, or precisely:
> 	a single bit parity check will detect any odd number of errors, but no even number of errors
