Which of the following is the appropriate explanation of the key value store that is used in
the processing of big data?

a) It is represented by a two-dimensional table with rows and columns based on the set theory.
b) It represents the relationship among nodes with the three (3) elements, i.e., “node,” “relationship,” and “property.”
c) It saves the desired data together with a value that enables this data to be uniquely identified as a pair.
d) The data for one (1) case is called a “document,” and the data structure of each document is unrestricted and can be changed whenever data is added.
? 
c) It saves the desired data together with a value that enables this data to be uniquely identified as a pair.

## Explanation
**Key-value Store**
- NoSQL database (non-relational)
- key serves as unique identifier
- efficient data retrieval by ==using the key to access the corresponding value==
- ideal for applications requiring fast lookups and scalability
- good for big data
