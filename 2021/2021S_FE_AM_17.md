? 

| c)  | Saving of the running<br>state | Selection of the process | Restoration of the<br>running state |

## Explanation

In the context of process switching the OS must do the following:
1)  **Save the current process**: The OS saves the state of the current process into a process control block (PCB). 
2) **Load the next process**: The OS loads the PCB of the next process to be executed. 
3) **Transfer control**: The OS transfers control to the next process.

### Hence, the answer is c)
