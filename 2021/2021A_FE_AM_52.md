In project time management, which of the following descriptions is appropriate for “slack time”?

a) It is the amount of time between the earliest start time and earliest finish time of an activity or between the latest start time and latest finish time of an activity. 
b) It is the amount of time for which a non-critical path activity can be deferred without delaying the project. 
c) It is the amount of time that an activity can be deferred without delaying the earliest start time of any succeeding activity or violating a schedule constraint. 
d) It is the amount of time that an activity can be delayed past its latest start time or latest finish time.
? 
b) It is the amount of time for which a non-critical path activity can be deferred without delaying the project. 
### Explanation

Slack time, also known as "float," is the amount of time an activity can be delayed without affecting the start of subsequent activities or the overall project completion date. This definition accurately reflects slack time in project time management.

### Why the Others Won't Fit

**a) It is the amount of time between the earliest start time and earliest finish time of an activity or between the latest start time and latest finish time of an activity.**

- This describes the duration of an activity, not slack time. Slack time specifically refers to how much an activity can be delayed without impacting other activities or the project.

**b) It is the amount of time for which a non-critical path activity can be deferred without delaying the project.**

- While this is close, it limits slack time to non-critical path activities. In reality, slack applies to any activity with float, not just those off the critical path.

**d) It is the amount of time that an activity can be delayed past its latest start time or latest finish time.**

- This statement is incorrect because once an activity is delayed past its latest start or finish time, it affects the project schedule. Slack time refers to how long an activity can be delayed _before_ this happens.
