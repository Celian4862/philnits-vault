Which of the following is the weakest module coupling?

a) To implement as many functions as possible with a single module 
b) To pass arguments that control another module’s logic when the module is called 
c) To pass only required data items as arguments between two (2) modules 
d) To use a global area to share data items with other modules
? 
c) To pass only required data items as arguments between two (2) modules 
### Explanation

According to [kharagpurcollege.ac.in/studyMaterial/173830Lecture-9-Coupling-cohesion, 2nd semester by Alok Haldar.pdf](https://www.kharagpurcollege.ac.in/studyMaterial/173830Lecture-9-Coupling-cohesion,%202nd%20semester%20by%20Alok%20Haldar.pdf), The coupling is **the degree of interdependence between software modules**. Two modules that are tightly coupled are strongly dependent on each other. Two modules that are loosely coupled are not dependent on each other.

**c) To pass only required data items as arguments between two (2) modules.**

- This option represents the weakest coupling between modules. By passing only the necessary data items, modules remain independent and less affected by changes in each other. This promotes better maintainability, as changes in one module are less likely to impact others, adhering to the principles of modularity.

### Why the Others Won't Fit

**a) To implement as many functions as possible with a single module.**

- This approach typically leads to high coupling because it combines multiple responsibilities within a single module, making it difficult to modify or test independently.

**b) To pass arguments that control another module’s logic when the module is called.**

- This creates tighter coupling between the modules, as one module is directly influencing the behavior of another. Changes in the controlling module could necessitate changes in the controlled module.

**d) To use a global area to share data items with other modules.**

- Using global variables for sharing data increases coupling significantly, as multiple modules may depend on the state of these shared variables. This can lead to issues with maintainability and can make it difficult to track data flow within the system.
