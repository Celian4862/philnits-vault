Based on the definition of project management process groups in ISO 21500, which of the following is an activity that is to be implemented in the planning process group among the project management processes? 

a) To define scope
b) To develop a project charter
c) To identify stakeholders 
d) To perform quality assurance
? 
a) To define scope
### Explanation

Defining the scope is a key activity in the planning process group according to ISO 21500. This process involves determining and documenting the specific goals, deliverables, and boundaries of the project, which is essential for creating a clear project plan.

### Why the Others Won't Fit

**b) To develop a project charter.**

- Developing a project charter is part of the initiation process group, not planning. The project charter formally authorizes the project and provides an initial understanding of objectives and stakeholders.

**c) To identify stakeholders.**

- Identifying stakeholders also falls under the initiation process group, as it involves recognizing those who have an interest in the project early on.

**d) To perform quality assurance.**

- Quality assurance is part of the execution or monitoring and controlling process groups, as it involves evaluating whether project activities meet quality standards, rather than planning.
