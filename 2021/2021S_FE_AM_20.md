Which of the following is the appropriate explanation of sequence control for controlling industrial devices?

a) It is based on fuzziness, such as “slightly more” or “slightly less.”
b) It is resistant to unexpected disturbances because it continuously detects the amount of
control and reflects it on the control.
c) It steps through each phase of control one after another according to a predefined order
or set of conditions.
d) It takes corrective action in advance by assuming the occurrence of disturbances when
disturbances can be expected.
? 
c) It steps through each phase of control one after another according to a predefined order
or set of conditions.

### Option a)
- describes fuzzy control

### Option b)
- describes feedback control
