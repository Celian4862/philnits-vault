Which of the following is the RAID level where the entire stored data is lost when one of
the multi-disks is damaged?

a) RAID 0 
b) RAID 1 
c) RAID 5 
d) RAID 6
? 
a) RAID 0
## Definitions
**RAID**
- Redundant Array of Independent Drives or 
- Redundant Array of Inexpensive Disks

### a) RAID 0 (ANSWER)
- data is split across disks 
- but no data redundancy
- good performance
- but ==if a drive broken, data is permanently lost==
### b) RAID 1
- uses mirroring
- data in one drive is duplicated to another
- data is not lost on disk failure
### c) RAID 5
- stripes data across multiple disks
- includes parity information
- can reconstruct data on one disk failure
### d) RAID 6
- similar to raid 5
- double parity
- adds extra parity info
- allows loss of two disks before data is compromised
